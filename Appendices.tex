\chapter{Colophon}
\label{app:Colophon}

This document has been written with \LaTeX, within Overleaf (\url{www.overleaf.com}), based on a template created by Ian Kirker\footnote{\url{https://github.com/UCL/ucl-latex-thesis-templates}}. 

During writing git was used as a version control software, pushing to GitHub, at \url{https://github.com/da5nsy/Thesis}. Upon final submission this repo will be made public, and future students are encouraged to re-use any formatting elements which have been developed on top of the template listed above.

The font used is Linux Libertine, which is a free and open font, available at \url{http://libertine-fonts.org/} or through the \LaTeX package `libertine'.

Zotero was used for reference management.

I am deeply grateful to the open source projects listed above.
