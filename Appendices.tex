This document has been written with \LaTeX, within a mix of TeXworks (locally) and Overleaf (when online), based on a template created by Ian Kirker\footnote{\url{https://github.com/UCL/ucl-latex-thesis-templates}}.

In addition to the packages used in the template, additional use was made of package `libertine'\footnote{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/libertine}}, which loads the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum font families which are free and open fonts\footnote{\url{http://libertine-fonts.org/}}. %and `microtype' which !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, also lineno \\
