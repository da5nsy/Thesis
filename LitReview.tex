This chapter shall provide summaries of the background information required to understand the content of this thesis, and also review the state of the art of the various subjects that this thesis covers.

\section{Colour Science}

Organisms on earth posses visual systems such that they can glean information about spatially remote objects through the sensing of light reflected from these objects towards the organism. They are able to do this because the sun emits electromagnetic radiation (which we call `light' when it is within our visual sensitivity range), our atmosphere transmits many parts of this radiation (absorbing some wavelengths more so than others), and objects absorb some and reflect some of this radiation (again, some wavelengths more so than others), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SPD}.

Our perception of colour generally correlates with the way in which objects preferentially reflect some wavelengths over others (described by the \acrfull{SRF}) which assists in the recognition of objects (that's a banana) and the discrimination of distinct objects, often in a manner that is ecologically beneficial (that's a \emph{ripe} banana).

\section{Interim Summary}

This chapter has laid out the most relevant developments in the research areas which the other chapters of this thesis build upon. 

Chapter \ref{chap:Interviews} builds upon our museum lighting knowledge by filling the gap in our understanding of how museum lighting is actually thought about and selected currently, and tries to identify the most fruitful avenue for future research which will allow the reduction of damage to objects in museums.

Chapters \ref{chap:LargeSphere} and \ref{chap:SmallSphere} target the interaction between colour constancy and \glspl{ipRGC}, using some of the methodologies covered in the Section \ref{sec:methodsforCC} and the knowledge of the physiology of \glspl{ipRGC} outlined in Section \ref{sec:ipRGCs} to build upon the experiments summarised in Section \ref{sec:ipRGCbeyond}.

Chapter \ref{chap:Tablet} investigates a new methodology (a variant of achromatic setting, described in Section \ref{sec:methodsforCC}) for performing colour constancy experiments, using museum spaces as test spaces due to their well controlled lighting environments.

Chapter \ref{chap:Melcomp} takes a more theoretical look at the relationship between colour constancy and \glspl{ipRGC} using a computational methodology, and the mathematical methods described in Section \ref{sec:math}.
