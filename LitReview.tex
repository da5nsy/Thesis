\section{Colour Science}

Organisms on earth posses visual systems such that they can glean information about spatially remote objects through the sensing of light reflected from these objects towards the organism. They are able to do this because the sun emits electromagnetic radiation (which we call `light' when it is within our visual sensitivity range), our atmosphere transmits many parts of this radiation (absorbing some wavelengths more-so than others), and objects absorb some and reflect some of this radiation (again, some wavelengths more-so than others).

Our perception of colour generally correlates with the way in which objects preferentially reflect some wavelengths over others (described by the \acrfull{SRF}) which assists in the recognition of objects (that's a banana) and the discrimination of distinct objects, often in a manner that it ecologically beneficial (that's a \emph{ripe} banana).
