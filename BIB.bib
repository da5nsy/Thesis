In addition, light therapy is effective for certain affective disorders, sleep problems, and circadian rhythm disruption. These biological and behavioral effects of light are influenced by a distinct photoreceptor in the eye, melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), in addition to conventional rods and cones. We summarize the neurophysiology of this newly described sensory pathway and consider implications for the measurement, production, and application of light. A new light-measurement strategy taking account of the complex photoreceptive inputs to these non-visual responses is proposed for use by researchers, and simple suggestions for artificial/architectural lighting are provided for regulatory authorities, lighting manufacturers, designers, and engineers.},

  abstract = {Summary
Using the photopigment melanopsin, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) respond directly to light to drive circadian clock resetting and pupillary constriction. We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information.},

  abstract = {For decades, rods and cones were thought to be the only photoreceptors in the mammalian retina. However, a population of atypical photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) expresses the photopigment melanopsin and is intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These ipRGCs are crucial for relaying light information from the retina to the brain to control circadian photoentrainment, pupillary light reflex, and sleep. ipRGCs were initially described as a uniform population involved solely in signaling irradiance for non-image forming functions. Recent work, however, has uncovered that ipRGCs are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular, cellular and functional levels, and could even be involved in image formation. This review summarizes our current understanding of the diversity of ipRGCs and their various roles in modulating behavior.},

  abstract = {Human vision starts with the activation of rod photoreceptors in dim light and short (S)-, medium (M)-, and long (L)- wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors in daylight. Recently a parallel, non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive pathway, arising from a population of retinal ganglion cells, was discovered in nocturnal rodents. These ganglion cells express the putative photopigment melanopsin and by signalling gross changes in light intensity serve the subconscious, 'non-image-forming' functions of circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction. Here we show an anatomically distinct population of 'giant', melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in the primate retina that, in addition to being intrinsically photosensitive, are strongly activated by rods and cones, and display a rare, S-Off, (L + M)-On type of colour-opponent receptive field. The intrinsic, rod and (L + M) cone-derived light responses combine in these giant cells to signal irradiance over the full dynamic range of human vision. In accordance with cone-based colour opponency, the giant cells project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay to primary visual cortex. Thus, in the diurnal trichromatic primate, 'non-image-forming' and conventional 'image-forming' retinal pathways are merged, and the melanopsin-based signal might contribute to conscious visual perception.},

  abstract = {The specificity of cone inputs to ganglion cells has implications for the development of retinal connections and the nature of information transmitted to higher areas of the brain. We introduce a rapid and precise method for measuring signs and magnitudes of cone inputs to visual neurons. Colors of stimuli are modulated around circumferences of three color planes in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. For each neuron, the projection of the preferred vector in each plane was estimated by averaging the response phases to clockwise and counterclockwise modulation. The signs and weights of cone inputs were derived directly from the preferred vectors. The efficiency of the method enables us to measure cone inputs at different temporal frequencies and short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cone adaptation levels. The results show that S-cone inputs to the parvocellular and magnocellular ganglion cells are negligible, which implies underlying connectional specificity in the retinal circuitry.},

  title = {Rethinking {{Colour Constancy}}},
  volume = {10},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Colour constancy needs to be reconsidered in light of the limits imposed by metamer mismatching. Metamer mismatching refers to the fact that two objects reflecting metameric light under one illumination may reflect non-metameric light under a second; so two objects appearing as having the same colour under one illuminant can appear as having different colours under a second. Yet since Helmholtz, object colour has generally been believed to remain relatively constant. The deviations from colour constancy registered in experiments are usually thought to be small enough that they do not contradict the notion of colour constancy. However, it is important to determine how the deviations from colour constancy relate to the limits metamer mismatching imposes on constancy. Hence, we calculated metamer mismatching's effect for the 20 Munsell papers and 8 pairs of illuminants employed in the colour constancy study by Logvinenko and Tokunaga and found it to be so extensive that the two notions\textemdash{}metamer mismatching and colour constancy\textemdash{}must be mutually exclusive. In particular, the notion of colour constancy leads to some paradoxical phenomena such as the possibility of 20 objects having the same colour under chromatic light dispersing into a hue circle of colours under neutral light. Thus, colour constancy refers to a phenomenon, which because of metamer mismatching, simply cannot exist. Moreover, it obscures the really important visual phenomenon; namely, the alteration of object colours induced by illumination change. We show that colour is not an independent, intrinsic attribute of an object, but rather an attribute of an object/light pair, and then define a concept of material colour in terms of equivalence classes of such object/light pairs. We suggest that studying the shift in material colour under a change in illuminant will be more fruitful than pursuing colour constancy's false premise that colour is an intrinsic attribute of an object.},

  abstract = {Summary
As the ear has dual functions for audition and balance, the eye has a dual role in detecting light for a wide range of behavioral and physiological functions separate from sight [1\textendash{}11]. These responses are driven primarily by stimulation of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that are most sensitive to short-wavelength ({$\sim$}480 nm) blue light and remain functional in the absence of rods and cones [8\textendash{}10]. We examined the spectral sensitivity of non-image-forming responses in two profoundly blind subjects lacking functional rods and cones (one male, 56 yr old; one female, 87 yr old). In the male subject, we found that short-wavelength light preferentially suppressed melatonin, reset the circadian pacemaker, and directly enhanced alertness compared to 555 nm exposure, which is the peak sensitivity of the photopic visual system. In an action spectrum for pupillary constriction, the female subject exhibited a peak spectral sensitivity ({$\lambda$}max) of 480 nm, matching that of the pRGCs but not that of the rods and cones. This subject was also able to correctly report a threshold short-wavelength stimulus ({$\sim$}480 nm) but not other wavelengths. Collectively these data show that pRGCs contribute to both circadian physiology and rudimentary visual awareness in humans and challenge the assumption that rod- and cone-based photoreception mediate all ``visual'' responses to light.},

The human retina contains melanopsin, but the literature lacks a direct investigation of its spectral sensitivity or G-protein selectivity. Here, we address this deficit by studying physiological responses driven by human melanopsin under heterologous expression in HEK293 cells. Luminescent reporters for common second messenger systems revealed that light induces a high amplitude increase in intracellular calcium and a modest reduction in cAMP in cells expressing human melanopsin, implying that this pigment is able to drive responses via both Gq and Gi/o class G-proteins. Melanopsins from mouse and amphioxus had a similar profile of G-protein coupling in HEK293 cells, but chicken Opn4m and Opn4x pigments exhibited some Gs activity in addition to a strong Gq/11 response. An action spectrum for the calcium response in cells expressing human melanopsin had the predicted form for an opsin : vitamin A1 pigment and peaked at 479 nm. The G-protein selectivity and spectral sensitivity of human melanopsin is similar to that previously described for rodents, supporting the utility of such laboratory animals for developing methods of manipulating this system using light or pharmacological agents.},

  issn = {0960-9822},
  abstract = {The mammalian eye shows marked adaptations to time of day. Some of these modifications are not acute responses to short-term light exposure but rely upon assessments of the photic environment made over several hours. In the past, all attempts at a mechanistic understanding have assumed that these adaptations originate with light detection by one or other of the classical photoreceptor cells (rods or cones). However, previous work has demonstrated that the mammalian eye contains non-rod, non-cone photoreceptors. This study aimed to determine whether such photoreceptors contribute to retinal adaptation., In the human retina, second-order processing of signals originating in cones takes significantly longer at night than during the day. Long-term light exposure at night is capable of reversing this effect. Here, we employed the cone ERG as a tool to examine the properties of the irradiance measurement pathway driving this reversal. Our findings indicate that this pathway (1) integrates irradiance measures over time periods ranging from at least 15 to 120 min; (2) responds to relatively bright light, having a dynamic range almost entirely outside the sensitivity of rods; (3) acts on the cone pathway primarily through a local retinal mechanism; and (4) detects light via an opsin:vitamin A photopigment ({$\lambda$}max {$\cong$} 483 nm)., A photopigment with a spectral sensitivity profile quite different from those of the classical rod and cone opsins but matching the standard profile of an opsin:vitamin A-based pigment drives adaptations of the human primary cone visual pathway according to time of day.},

  abstract = {The photopigment in the human eye that transduces light for circadian and neuroendocrine regulation, is unknown. The aim of this study was to establish an action spectrum for light-induced melatonin suppression that could help elucidate the ocular photoreceptor system for regulating the human pineal gland. Subjects (37 females, 35 males, mean age of 24.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 years) were healthy and had normal color vision. Full-field, monochromatic light exposures took place between 2:00 and 3:30 A.M. while subjects' pupils were dilated. Blood samples collected before and after light exposures were quantified for melatonin. Each subject was tested with at least seven different irradiances of one wavelength with a minimum of 1 week between each nighttime exposure. Nighttime melatonin suppression tests (n = 627) were completed with wavelengths from 420 to 600 nm. The data were fit to eight univariant, sigmoidal fluence\textendash{}response curves (R 2 = 0.81\textendash{}0.95). The action spectrum constructed from these data fit an opsin template (R 2 = 0.91), which identifies 446\textendash{}477 nm as the most potent wavelength region providing circadian input for regulating melatonin secretion. The results suggest that, in humans, a single photopigment may be primarily responsible for melatonin suppression, and its peak absorbance appears to be distinct from that of rod and cone cell photopigments for vision. The data also suggest that this new photopigment is retinaldehyde based. These findings suggest that there is a novel opsin photopigment in the human eye that mediates circadian photoreception.},

Healthy subjects with stable sleeping patterns (wake-up time 7:30 AM {$\pm$} 12 min) and normal color vision were exposed at night to full-field 505 nm or 555 nm monochromatic stimuli or darkness for 90 min. Plasma collected before and after exposures was quantified for melatonin. Subjects exposed to 10 irradiances at 505 nm showed no significant differences across mean pre-exposure melatonin values (F=0.505). A sigmoidal fluence-response curve fitted to the melatonin suppression data (R2=0.97) indicated that 9.34 \texttimes{} 1012 photons/cm2/sec induced a half-saturation response (ED50) while 6.84 \texttimes{} 1013 photons/cm2/sec induced a saturation melatonin suppression response. Further, a dose of 4.19 \texttimes{} 1013 photon/cm2/sec at 505 nm was significantly stronger (P {$<$} 0.01) than an equal photon dose at 555 nm for melatonin suppression. These data demonstrate that the cone system that mediates human photopic vision is not the primary photoreceptor system to tranduce light stimuli for melatonin regulation.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin has been proposed to be the photopigment of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs); these photoreceptors of the mammalian eye drive circadian and pupillary adjustments through direct projections to the brain. Their action spectrum ( max 480 nm) implicates an opsin and melanopsin is the only opsin known to exist in these cells. Melanopsin is required for ipRGC photosensitivity and for behavioural photoresponses that survive disrupted rod and cone function. Heterologously expressed melanopsin apparently binds retinaldehyde and mediates photic activation of G proteins. However, its amino-acid sequence differs from vertebrate photosensory opsins and some have suggested that melanopsin may be a photoisomerase, providing retinoid chromophore to an unidentified opsin. To determine whether melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, here we transiently expressed it in HEK293 cells that stably expressed TRPC3 channels. Light triggered a membrane depolarization in these cells and increased intracellular calcium. The light response resembled that of ipRGCs, with almost identical spectral sensitivity ( max 479 nm). The phototransduction pathway included Gq or a related G protein, phospholipase C and TRPC3 channels. We conclude that mammalian melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, that it is the photopigment of ganglion-cell photoreceptors, and that these photoreceptors may use an invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade.},

The predicted secondary structure of melanopsin indicates the presence of a long cytoplasmic tail with multiple putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that this opsin's function may be finely regulated. Melanopsin mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic sites thought to contain deep brain photoreceptors and in the iris, a structure known to be directly photosensitive in amphibians. Melanopsin message is also localized in retinal cells residing in the outermost lamina of the inner nuclear layer where horizontal cells are typically found. Its expression in retinal and nonretinal tissues suggests a role in vision and nonvisual photoreceptive tasks, such as photic control of skin pigmentation, pupillary aperture, and circadian and photoperiodic physiology.},

  abstract = {In mammals, a small number of retinal ganglion cells express melanopsin, an opsin photopigment, allowing them to be directly photoreceptive. A major function of these so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is to synchronize (entrain) endogenous circadian clocks to the external light:dark cycle. Thanks to their intrinsic light response, ipRGCs can support photoentrainment even when the other retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are absent or inactive. However, in the intact retina the ipRGC light response is a composite of extrinsic (rod/cone) and intrinsic (melanopsin) influences. As a result all three photoreceptor classes contribute to the retinal pathways providing light information to the clock. Here, we consider what each photoreceptor type contributes to the clock light response. We review electrophysiological and behavioral data pertinent to this question, primarily from laboratory rodents, drawing them together to provide a conceptual model in which each photoreceptor class plays a distinct role in encoding the light environment. We finally use this model to highlight some of the important outstanding questions in this field.},

  abstract = {A direct projection from melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) reaches the primary visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; dLGN). The significance of this melanopsin input to the visual system is only recently being investigated. One unresolved question is the degree to which neurons in the dLGN could use melanopsin to track dynamic changes in light intensity under light adapted conditions. Here we set out to address this question. We were able to present full field steps visible only to melanopsin by switching between rod-isoluminant `yellow' and `blue' lights in a mouse lacking cone function (Cnga3 -/- ). In the retina these stimuli elicited melanopsin-like responses from a subset of ganglion cells. When presented to anaesthetised mice, we found that \textasciitilde{}25-30\% of visually responsive neurones in the contralateral dLGN responded to these melanopsin-isolating steps with small increases in firing rate. Such responses could be elicited even with fairly modest increases in effective irradiance (32\% Michelson contrast for melanopsin). These melanopsin-driven responses were apparent at bright backgrounds (corresponding to twilight-daylight conditions), but their threshold irradiance was strongly dependent upon prior light exposure when stimuli were superimposed on a spectrally neutral ramping background light. While both onset and offset latencies were long for melanopsin-derived responses compared to those evoked by rods, there was great variability in these parameters with some cells responding to melanopsin steps in \&lt;1 s. These data indicate that a subset of dLGN units can employ melanopsin signals to detect modest changes in irradiance under photopic conditions.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are depolarized by light by two mechanisms: directly, through activation of their photopigment melanopsin; and indirectly through synaptic circuits driven by rods and cones. To learn more about the rod and cone circuits driving ipRGCs, we made multielectrode array (MEA) and patch-clamp recordings in wildtype and genetically modified mice. Rod-driven ON inputs to ipRGCs proved to be as sensitive as any reaching the conventional ganglion cells. These signals presumably pass in part through the primary rod pathway, involving rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells coupled to ON cone bipolar cells through gap junctions. Consistent with this interpretation, the sensitive rod ON input to ipRGCs was eliminated by pharmacological or genetic disruption of gap junctions, as previously reported for conventional ganglion cells. A presumptive cone input was also detectable as a brisk, synaptically mediated ON response that persisted after disruption of rod ON pathways. This was roughly three log units less sensitive than the rod input. Spectral analysis revealed that both types of cones, the M- and S-cones, contribute to this response and that both cone types drive ON responses. This contrasts with the blue-OFF, yellow-ON chromatic opponency reported in primate ipRGCs. The cone-mediated response was surprisingly persistent during steady illumination, echoing the tonic nature of both the rod input to ipRGCs and their intrinsic, melanopsin-based phototransduction. These synaptic inputs greatly expand the dynamic range and spectral bandpass of the non-image-forming visual functions for which ipRGCs provide the principal retinal input.},

  abstract = {Three types of international recommendations are necessary on CATs (chromatic adaptation transforms). CAT-Type I and CAT-Type II are for general use on chromatic adaptation studies. The former is related to chromatic adaptation theory and the latter to performance on field trial data. In addition, CAT-Type III is necessary for a specific and practical purposes. The need for classifying to CAT-Type I and CAT-Type II is found from a careful inspection of the development process from Nayatani et al. transform to BFD transform, referring to the Ph. D. thesis by Lam (University of Bradford, 1985). The process clearly shows two types of flows on the development of various CATs. One is the flow for deepening the theory of chromatic adaptation (CAT-Type I), and the other is for giving good performance to existing field trial data and also ease of use (CAT-Type II). Additional CAT-Type III is, for example, CAT recommended in CIE TC 8-04 technical report. The CAT is only applicable to compare hardcopy and softcopy images for the specified observing conditions in the report. Still, a difficult problem, determination of corresponding colors, remains in the method of subjective estimation, which is useful and widely used for estimating chromatic adaptation effects experimentally. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  title = {Tracking {{Categorical Surface Colour Across Illuminant Changes In Natural Scenes}}},
  volume = {2010},
  abstract = {How well can categorical colour perception be maintained in natural environments with varying illuminants? To address this question, a colour-naming experiment was performed with colour-monitor images of natural scenes simulated under two different daylights of correlated colour temperature 6500 K and 25000 K. Images were obtained from a set of hyperspectral data to enable the accurate control of illuminant and reflectance spectra. Each scene contained a spherical test surface whose digitally manipulated spectral reflectance coincided with that of a sample drawn randomly from approximately 430 Munsell reflectances grouped into eight colour categories, namely, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, purple, brown, and orange. Observers had to name the colour of the test surface in each image, presented for 1 s, by pressing one of nine computer keys corresponding to the eight categorical colour names and a neutral category. Focal colours were estimated from the peaks of the smoothed distributions of observers' naming responses in the CIE 1976 (u{${'}$}, v{${'}$}) chromaticity diagram. The effect of the illuminant change was quantified by a focal colour constancy index, with values 0 and 1 corresponding to no constancy and perfect constancy. Average levels of focal colour constancy were close to those from traditional measures of colour constancy, but with variation across categories and surface lightness. For blue and purple surfaces levels approached 0.9. For many surface colours, colour naming seems to be robust under illuminant changes and may help to anchor non-categorical judgements of arbitrary surface colours in natural scenes.},

  abstract = {In computer vision, colour naming has been posed as a fuzzy-set problem where each colour category is modeled by a function that assigns a membership value to any given sample. However, the success in the automation of this process relies on having an appropriate psychophysical data set for this purpose. In this article we present a data set obtained from a colour-naming experiment. In this experiment, we used a scoring method to collect a set of judgments adequate for the fuzzy modeling of the colour-naming task. The data set is composed of 387 colour reflectances, their CIELab and Munsell values, and the corresponding judgments provided by the subjects in the experiment. These judgments are the membership values to the 11 basic colour categories proposed by Berlin and Kay (Berlin B, Kay P. Berkeley: University of California; 1969). All these data have been made available online (http://www.cvc.uab.es/color\_naming) and, in this article we provide a wide analysis of them. To prove the suitability of the proposed scoring methodology, we have computed a set of common statistics in colour-naming experiments, such as consensus and consistency, on our data set. The results make it possible for us to conclude the coherence of our data with previous experiments and, thus, its usefulness for the fuzzy modeling of colour naming. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Ishihara under Exner's supervision at the beginning of the century. Rushton provided a theoretical framework for the method with the enunciation of his ``principle of univariance'', In this paper we show how the ``silent substitution'' concept can be further generalized to any arbitrary number of photoreceptor classes by making use of well-established concepts of colorimetry. With this approach, which we have called ``spectral compensation'', one also gains a better insight into the possibilities and shortcomings of the technique. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to examine a number of published studies where use has been made of ``silent substitution'', with particular emphasis on the work of W.A.H. Rushton.},

After careful examination of color matching data, TC 1- 36 has agreed on proposing a continuous fundamental observer with data from 10\textdegree{} to 1\textdegree. The 10\textdegree{} color matching measurements of Stiles and Burch (1959) will provide the basic data for this continuous fundamental observer. Fundamental response curves will be derived as a function of field size, taking into account the macular pigment, the ocular media and the photopigment optical densities.},

When this system of discs is set in rapid rotation, the sectors of the different colours become indistinguishable, and the whole appears of one uniform tint. The resultant tints of two different combinations of colours may be compared by using a second set of discs of a smaller size, and placing these over the centre of the first set, so as to leave the outer portion of the larger discs exposed. The resultant tint of the first combination will then appear in a ring round that of the second, and may be very carefully compared with it.},

The present paper discusses procedures for accomplishing the decomposition or resolution of any visual stimulus into these components. These methods rest on the fact that the color-stimulus space is a space of three dimensions and the metameric black space is orthogonal to it. Introduced and given specific attention here is the particular procedure wherein the stimulus-energy vector is premultiplied by A(A{${'}$} A)-1A{${'}$}, A being any matrix of experimentally established color-mixture data with three linearly independent columns (primaries). This computation provides the fundamental metamer (as we shall call it) of the visual stimulus being analyzed. The difference between the stimulus-energy distribution and the fundamental metameric function provides the metameric black function. Examples of both types of functions are given and discussed.},

  title = {Selective {{Stimulation}} of {{Penumbral Cones Reveals Perception}} in the {{Shadow}} of {{Retinal Blood Vessels}}},
  volume = {10},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {In 1819, Johann Purkinje described how a moving light source that displaces the shadow of the retinal blood vessels to adjacent cones can produce the entopic percept of a branching tree. Here, we describe a novel method for producing a similar percept. We used a device that mixes 56 narrowband primaries under computer control, in conjunction with the method of silent substitution, to present observers with a spectral modulation that selectively targeted penumbral cones in the shadow of the retinal blood vessels. Such a modulation elicits a clear Purkinje-tree percept. We show that the percept is specific to penumbral L and M cone stimulation and is not produced by selective penumbral S cone stimulation. The Purkinje-tree percept was strongest at 16 Hz and fell off at lower (8 Hz) and higher (32 Hz) temporal frequencies. Selective stimulation of open-field cones that are not in shadow, with penumbral cones silenced, also produced the percept, but it was not seen when penumbral and open-field cones were modulated together. This indicates the need for spatial contrast between penumbral and open-field cones to create the Purkinje-tree percept. Our observation provides a new means for studying the response of retinally stabilized images and demonstrates that penumbral cones can support spatial vision. Further, the result illustrates a way in which silent substitution techniques can fail to be silent. We show that inadvertent penumbral cone stimulation can accompany melanopsin-directed modulations that are designed only to silence open-field cones. This in turn can result in visual responses that might be mistaken as melanopsin-driven.},

  abstract = {Signals from cones are recombined in postreceptoral channels [luminance, L + M; red-green, L - M; blue-yellow, S - (L + M)]. The melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are also active at daytime light levels and recent psychophysical results suggest that melanopsin contributes to conscious vision in humans. Here, we measured BOLD fMRI responses to spectral modulations that separately targeted the postreceptoral cone channels and melanopsin. Responses to spatially uniform (27.5\textdegree{} field size, central 5\textdegree{} obscured) flicker at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 Hz were recorded from areas V1, V2/V3, motion-sensitive area MT, and the lateral occipital complex. In V1 and V2/V3, higher temporal sensitivity was observed to L + M + S (16 Hz) compared with L - M flicker (8 Hz), consistent with psychophysical findings. Area MT was most sensitive to rapid (32 Hz) flicker of either L + M + S or L - M. We found S cone responses only in areas V1 and V2/V3 (peak frequency: 4\textendash{}8 Hz). In addition, we studied an L + M modulation and found responses that were effectively identical at all temporal frequencies to those recorded for the L + M + S modulation. Finally, we measured the cortical response to melanopsin-directed flicker and compared this response with control modulations that addressed stimulus imprecision and the possibility of stimulation of cones in the shadow of retinal blood vessels (penumbral cones). For our stimulus conditions, melanopsin flicker did not elicit a cortical response exceeding that of the control modulations. We note that failure to control for penumbral cone stimulation could be mistaken for a melanopsin response.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The retina contains cone photoreceptors and ganglion cells that contain the photopigment melanopsin. Cones provide brightness and color signals to visual cortex. Melanopsin influences circadian rhythm and the pupil, but its contribution to cortex and perception is less clear. We measured the response of human visual cortex with fMRI using spectral modulations tailored to stimulate the cones and melanopsin separately. We found that cortical responses to cone signals vary systematically across visual areas. Differences in temporal sensitivity for achromatic, red-green, and blue-yellow stimuli generally reflect the known perceptual properties of vision. We found that melanopsin signals do not produce a measurable response in visual cortex at temporal frequencies between 0.5 and 64 Hz at daytime light levels.},

  title = {Investigating Melanopsin Contribution to Scene Brightness Perception},
  copyright = {Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.},
  abstract = {Human brightness perception is the result of at least three visual channels: The achromatic luminance channel, the red-green (R-G) color opponent channel and the blue-yellow (B-Y) color opponent channel. Short-wavelength output of light sources enhances brightness perception for stimuli subtending large visual angles in the low-to-moderate photopic range (\textasciitilde{}2 lux - \textasciitilde{}150 lux). This is partially explained by a contribution of short-wavelength (S) cones. Recent evidence from experiments conducted with mice as well as humans suggests that intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing the photopigment melanopsin might also underlie increased short-wavelength spectral sensitivity of human brightness perception. The objective of the present thesis was to investigate whether melanopsin could be contributing directly to human scene brightness perception. Two experimental investigations of the relative potential contribution of S-cones (B-Y opponent color channel) and ipRGCs to scene brightness at 6 light levels between 2 lux and 150 lux were conducted. Subjects provided forced-choice brightness judgments and relative brightness magnitude judgments at two light level ranges, with two different stimuli presented sequentially in counterbalanced order. Experiment 1 used a "Green" stimulus composed of LED illumination peaking at 525 nm and 625 nm, and a "Fuchsia" stimulus composed of LEDs peaking at 465 nm and 625 nm. S-cone stimulation from the Green stimulus was only 10\% of that from the Fuchsia stimulus, melanopsin stimulation however was substantial (for both stimuli). The hypothesis was therefore that Green would be perceived as brighter than predicted by a provisional brightness model developed by Rea et al. (2011) that only takes into account cone responses, and not melanopsin. Experiment 2 used two "Amber" stimuli, one composed of an LED with peak output at 599 nm (Amber 1), and another composed of LEDs peaking at 520 nm and 635 nm (Amber 2). While both stimuli had negligible S-cone stimulation, Amber 2 did stimulate melanopsin 8 times more than Amber 1 for the same photopic light level. The hypothesis was therefore that if melanopsin were to contribute to brightness perception, Amber 2 would be perceived as brighter than Amber 1. Brightness judgments for the stimuli with higher potential for melanopsin stimulation were indeed higher in both experiments than would be predicted if S-cones were the only short-wavelength-sensitive mechanism contributing to brightness perception, thus supporting the possibility of melanopsin contribution. Post hoc analysis using data from Experiment 1 and 2, and utilizing previously published (in 2011 and 2013) provisional brightness models as a foundation, showed that the data could be fitted well by modifying the relative S-cone contribution in the equations and including a melanopsin coefficient that increased relative to an increase in light level. This refined model also predicted results from prior experiments. The improvements between this new model and the 2011 model were relatively large, while they were not as large in comparison with the previous 2013 model. The ability to quantify and predict scene brightness perception evoked by a particular light source opens up the possibility of optimizing lighting solutions for maximum brightness and minimum energy usage. Brightness appears to be related to pedestrians' perceived security in night-time outdoor spaces; thus brightness as a metric becomes a meaningful criterion for outdoor lighting.},

  abstract = {On several paintings by artists of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th Century a darkening of the original yellow areas, painted with the chrome yellow pigment (PbCrO4, PbCrO4{$\cdot$}xPbSO4, or PbCrO4{$\cdot$}xPbO) is observed. The most famous of these are the various Sunflowers paintings Vincent van Gogh made during his career. In the first part of this work, we attempt to elucidate the degradation process of chrome yellow by studying artificially aged model samples. In view of the very thin (1-3 {$\mu$}m) alteration layers that are formed, high lateral resolution spectroscopic methods such as microscopic X-ray absorption near edge ({$\mu$}-XANES), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry ({$\mu$}-XRF), and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) were employed. Some of these use synchrotron radiation (SR). Additionally, microscopic SR X-ray diffraction (SR {$\mu$}-XRD), {$\mu$}-Raman, and mid-FTIR spectroscopy were employed to completely characterize the samples. The formation of Cr(III) compounds at the surface of the chrome yellow paint layers is particularly observed in one aged model sample taken from a historic paint tube (ca. 1914). About two-thirds of the chromium that is present at the surface has reduced from the hexavalent to the trivalent state. The EELS and {$\mu$}-XANES spectra are consistent with the presence of Cr2O3{$\cdot$}2H2O (viridian). Moreover, as demonstrated by {$\mu$}-XANES, the presence of another Cr(III) compound, such as either Cr2(SO4)3{$\cdot$}H2O or (CH3CO2)7Cr3(OH)2 [chromium(III) acetate hydroxide], is likely.},

  abstract = {Little scientific evidence is available to document the state of museum exhibition lighting regarding occupant and decision maker needs or the mismatches (disparities) between needs and "reality" which exist in actual settings. Without knowledge of constituent needs or of the existing situation, decision making is ineffective and improvement is unlikely.
Building diagnostics provides a framework for this project. The diagnostic process serves as an essential link in more closely matching building performance stated needs with "reality" (perceived and existing physical conditions).
This work provides the essential research base for architectural decision making and formulation of appropriate strategies to improve museum lighting performance. First, needs of various constituencies are determined, then the problems associated with perceived and instrument measured "reality" are identified, and finally the mismatches between need and "reality" are highlighted.
The study included a survey of 130 museum personnel and lighting designers and 427 museum visitors to determine the needs of these constituencies. The current status of exhibition lighting was assessed via a comprehensive evaluation using both objective (instrument-based) and subjective measures of lighting performance in 39 electrically-lit and daylit galleries from 22 museums throughout the United States. Appropriate univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were used to consolidate the data.
Analysis of this sample revealed that the important stated needs of decision makers and visitors were not met in "reality". The major decision maker mismatch was daylight management as related to artifact preservation in daylit galleries and the major visitor mismatch was artifact appearance in electrically-lit galleries.
Study results suggest the limited resources available should be directed toward minimizing glare, enhancing artifact appearance in terms of color richness and detail visibility, and improving the effectiveness of daylight management to protect artifacts as related to illuminance and relative humidity. Specific improvement strategies are identified.},

Problems associated with existing conditions were assessed via a comprehensive evaluation using instrument-based lighting measures applied in 39 electrically-lit and daylit galleries (rooms) in 22 U.S. museums. Mismatches between expectations and existing exhibition lighting conditions were summarized. Analysis: Factor analysis was used to consolidate the data. The Friedman test was applied to determine significant differences between mean factor responses. Key Findings: Decision makers and visitors have different expectations. Neither group's priority expectations are met in existing conditions. The major problem among decision makers is daylight management for artifact preservation in daylit galleries. The major problem for visitors is artifact appearance and visibility. Conclusions: Successful design depends on informed decision making, which must be based on documented evidence, not speculation, and should address stakeholders' expectations and field performance problems.

  abstract = {Color perception depends profoundly on adaptation processes that adjust sensitivity in response to the prevailing pattern of stimulation. We examined how color sensitivity and appearance might be influenced by adaptation to the color distributions characteristic of natural images. Color distributions were measured for natural scenes by sampling an array of locations within each scene with a spectroradiometer, or by recording each scene with a digital camera successively through 31 interference filters. The images were used to reconstruct the L, M and S cone excitation at each spatial location, and the contrasts along three post-receptoral axes [L + M, L - M or S - (L + M)]. Individual scenes varied substantially in their mean chromaticity and luminance, in the principal color-luminance axes of their distributions, and in the range of contrasts in their distributions. Chromatic contrasts were biased along a relatively narrow range of bluish to yellowish-green angles, lying roughly between the S - (L + M) axis (which was more characteristic of scenes with lush vegetation and little sky) and a unique blue-yellow axis (which was more typical of arid scenes). For many scenes L - M and S - (L + M) signals were highly correlated, with weaker correlations between luminance and chromaticity. We use a two-stage model (von Kries scaling followed by decorrelation) to show how the appearance of colors may be altered by light adaptation to the mean if the distributions and by contrast adaptation to the contrast range and principal axes of the distributions; and we show that such adjustments are qualitatively consistent with empirical measurements of asymmetric color matches obtained after adaptation to successive random samples drawn from natural distributions of chromaticities and lightnesses. Such adaptation effects define the natural range of operating states of the visual system.},

  issn = {0042-6989},
  abstract = {Adaptation to a steady background has a profound effect on both color appearance and discrimination. We determined the temporal characteristics of chromatic adaptation for appearance and discrimination along different color directions. Subjects were adapted to a large uniform background made up of a CRT screen and a 45\texttimes{}64\textdegree{} wall, illuminated by computer controlled lamps. After an instant change in background color along a red\textendash{}green or blue\textendash{}yellow color axis, we measured thresholds for the detection of increments along the same axes at fixed times between 25 ms and 121 s. Analogously, color appearance was determined using achromatic matching. Three components of adaptation could be identified by their temporal characteristics. A slow exponential time course of adaptation with a half-life of about 20 s was common to appearance and discrimination. A faster component with a half-life of 40\textendash{}70 ms \textemdash{} probably due to photoreceptor adaptation \textemdash{} was also common to both. Exclusive for color appearance, there was a third, extremely rapid mechanism with a half-life faster than 10 ms. This instantaneous process explained more than 50\% of total adaptation for color appearance and could be shown to act in a multiplicative manner. We conclude that this instantaneous adaptation mechanism for color appearance is situated at a later processing stage, after mechanisms common to appearance and discrimination, and is based on multiplicative spatial interactions rather than on local, temporal adaptational processes. Color appearance, and thus color constancy, seems to be determined in large part by cortical computations.},

For art preservation and energy saving reasons this is not feasible. Museums often use light of 3500 K correlated colour temperature (CCT). A method is described that takes chromatic adaptation into consideration to determine the spectral power distribution producing least colour distortion of object colours while changing from a higher adaptation luminance at 6500 K to 3500 K illumination at a lower adaptation luminance. The method can be used for any CCT and adaptation luminance values.},

  abstract = {Color constancy was studied under conditions simulating either natural or extremely artificial illumination. Four test illuminants were used: two broadband phases of daylight (correlated color temperatures 4000 and 25,000 K) and two spectrally impoverished metamers of these lights, each consisting of only two wavelengths. A computer controlled color monitor was used for reproducing the chromaticities and luminances of an array of Munsell color samples rendered under these illuminants. An asymmetric haploscopic matching paradigm was used in which the same stimulus pattern, either illuminated by one of the test illuminants, or by a standard broadband daylight (D65), was alternately presented to the left and right eye. Subjects adjusted the RGB settings of the samples seen under D65 (match condition), to match the appearance of the color samples seen under the test illuminant. The results show the expected failure of color constancy under two-wavelengths illumination, and approximate color constancy under natural illumination. Quantitative predictions of the results were made on the basis of two different models, a computational model for recovering surface reflectance, and a model that assumes the color response to be determined by cone-specific contrast and absolute level of stimulation (Lucassen and Walraven, 1993). The latter model was found to provide somewhat more accurate predictions, under all illuminant conditions. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  volume = {38},
  issn = {0031-3203},
  abstract = {Colour can potentially provide useful information for a variety of computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, image retrieval, object recognition and tracking. However, for it to be helpful in practice, colour must relate directly to the intrinsic properties of the imaged objects and be independent of imaging conditions such as scene illumination and the imaging device. To this end many invariant colour representations have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, recent work (Second Workshop on Content-based Multimedia Indexing) has shown that none of them provides good enough practical performance.

In this paper we propose a new colour invariant image representation based on an existing grey-scale image enhancement technique: histogram equalisation. We show that provided the rank ordering of sensor responses are preserved across a change in imaging conditions (lighting or device) a histogram equalisation of each channel of a colour image renders it invariant to these conditions. We set out theoretical conditions under which rank ordering of sensor responses is preserved and we present empirical evidence which demonstrates that rank ordering is maintained in practice for a wide range of illuminants and imaging devices. Finally, we apply the method to an image indexing application and show that the method out performs all previous invariant representations, giving close to perfect illumination invariance and very good performance across a change in device.},

When first-stage adaptation is modeled using multiplicative or subtractive mechanisms, or a monotonic nonlinearity, no reordering of the rank ordering of photon catches is possible across illuminant changes. The observed rank orderings remained nearly invariant across illuminant changes for all three photoreceptor classes, although there was some local shifting in the rank orderings, thus ruling out the ability of von Kries adaptation alone to produce perfect color constancy. This means that for objects with natural reflectance spectra, the ordinal relationships between the photon catches within a class of photoreceptors exhibit only minor changes for these illuminant shifts. This result may be attributable to the fact that approx. 95\% of the variance in these reflectance spectra is captured by the first principal component; objects that produce relatively few absorptions under one phase of daylight illumination will also produce relatively few absorptions under another phase. A geometric formalism for understanding these relationships is presented, and limitations on this analysis are discussed.},

  abstract = {The perceived colors of reflecting surfaces generally remain stable despite changes in the spectrum of the illuminating light. This color constancy can be measured operationally by asking observers to distinguish illuminant changes on a scene from changes in the reflecting properties of the surfaces comprising it. It is shown here that during fast illuminant changes, simultaneous changes in spectral reflectance of one or more surfaces in an array of other surfaces can be readily detected almost independent of the numbers of surfaces, suggesting a preattentive, spatially parallel process. This process, which is perfect over a spatial window delimited by the anatomical fovea, may form an early input to a multistage analysis of surface color, providing the visual system with information about a rapidly changing world in advance of the generation of a more elaborate and stable perceptual representation.},

For our psychophysical studies, we used a simplified version of the Land experiments [Land, E. (1974) Proc. R. Inst. G. B. 47, 23\textendash{}58] to learn whether color constancy mechanisms are intact in him, which amounts to learning whether he can assign a constant color to a surface in spite of changes in the precise wavelength composition of the light reflected from that surface. We supplemented our psychophysical studies with imaging ones, using functional magnetic resonance, to learn something about the location of areas that are active in his brain when he perceives colors. The psychophysical results suggested that color constancy mechanisms are severely defective in PB and that his color vision is wavelength-based. The imaging results showed that, when he viewed and recognized colors, significant increases in activity were restricted mainly to V1-V2. We conclude that a partly defective color system operating on its own in a severely damaged brain is able to mediate a conscious experience of color in the virtually total absence of other visual abilities.},

  abstract = {Color constancy can be achieved by analyzing the chromatic aberration in an image. Chromatic aberration spatially separates light of different wavelengths and this allows the spectral power distribution of the light to be extracted. This is more information about the light than is registered by the cones of the human visual system or by a color television camera; and, using it, we show how color constancy, the separation of reflectance from illumination, can be achieved. As examples, we consider grey-level images of (a) a colored dot under unknown illumination, and (b) an edge between two differently colored regions under unknown illumination. Our first result is that in principle we can determine completely the spectral power distribution of the reflected light from the dot or, in the case of the color edge, the difference in the spectral power distributions of the light from the two regions. By employing a finite-dimensional linear model of illumination and surface reflectance, we obtain our second result, which is that the spectrum of the reflected light can be uniquely decomposed into a component due to the illuminant and another component due to the surface reflectance. This decomposition provides the complete spectral reflectance function, and hence color, of the surface as well as the spectral power distribution of the illuminant. Up to the limit of the accuracy of the finite-dimensional model, this effectively solves the color constancy problem.},

Previous perceptual studies have assumed that the brain analyses the colour of a surface independently of its three-dimensional shape and viewing geometry, although there are neural connections between colour and two-dimensional form processing early in the visual pathway. Here we show that colour perception is strongly influenced by three-dimensional shape perception in a novel, chromatic version of the Mach Card\textemdash{}a concave folded card with one side made of magenta paper and the other of white paper. The light reflected from the magenta paper casts a pinkish glow on the white side.

The effect demonstrates that the human visual system incorporates knowledge of mutual illumination\textemdash{}the physics of light reflection between surfaces\textemdash{}at an early stage in colour perception.},

In this situation, the color of one or both surfaces can be modified by a color-bleeding effect. In this article we examine how sensor values (e.g., RGB values) are modified in the mutual reflection region and show that a good approximation of the surface spectral reflectance function for each surface can be recovered by using the extra information from mutual reflection. Thus color constancy results from an examination of mutual reflection. Use is made of finite dimensional linear models for ambient illumination and for surface spectral reflectance. If m and n are the number of basis functions required to model illumination and surface spectral reflectance respectively, then we find that the number of different sensor classes p must satisfy the condition p{$\geq$}(2 n+m)/3. If we use three basis functions to model illumination and three basis functions to model surface spectral reflectance, then only three classes of sensors are required to carry out the algorithm. Results are presented showing a small increase in error over the error inherent in the underlying finite dimension models.},

The basic hypothesis is that the estimate of the illuminant is made on the basis of spatial information from the entire visual field. This estimate is then used by the visual system to arrive at an estimate of the (object) reflectance of the various subfields in the complex visual scene. The estimates are made by matching the inputs to the system to linear combinations of fixed bases and standards in the colour space.

Similarly thresholds for yellowish and bluish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying along a yellowish-bluish axis but are not altered by exposure to reddish-greenish variation. Thresholds for chromatic changes are not raised following viewing a field varying in luminance. Thresholds for changes in luminance are raised following viewing a field varying in luminance but not altered by exposure to purely chromatic variation. Since this selectivity is found only for these directions and not intermediate directions in color space we conclude that these directions are cardinal, that is, signals varying along these directions are carried along separate, fatiguable, second stage pathways.

The influences of this novel opsin are widespread, ranging from pupillary and circadian responses to brightness perception, yet established approaches to quantifying the biological effects of light do not adequately account for melanopsin sensitivity. We have recently proposed a novel metric, the melanopic sensitivity function (V Z {$\lambda$}), to address this deficiency. Here, we further validate this new measure with a variety of tests based on potential barriers to its applicability identified in the literature or relating to obvious practical benefits. Using electrophysiogical approaches and pupillometry, initially in rodless+coneless mice, our data demonstrate that under a very wide range of different conditions (including switching between stimuli with highly divergent spectral content) the V Z {$\lambda$} function provides an accurate prediction of the sensitivity of melanopsin-dependent responses. We further show that V Z {$\lambda$} provides the best available description of the spectral sensitivity of at least one aspect of the visual response in mice with functional rods and cones: tonic firing activity in the lateral geniculate nuclei. Together, these data establish V Z {$\lambda$} as an important new approach for light measurement with widespread practical utility.},

This property of colour constancy has been assumed to be fundamental to vision, and many experimental attempts have been made to quantify it. I contend here, however, that the usual methods of measurement are either too coarse or concentrate not on colour constancy itself, but on other, complementary aspects of scene perception. Whether colour constancy exists other than in nominal terms remains unclear.},

  shorttitle = {Primed to Be Inflexible},
  abstract = {One of the hallmarks of human cognition is cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt thoughts and behaviors according to changing task demands. Previous research has suggested that the number of different exemplars that must be processed within a task (the set size) can influence an individual's ability to switch flexibly between different tasks. This paper provides evidence that when tasks have a small set size, children's cognitive flexibility is impaired compared to when tasks have a large set size. This paper also offers insights into the mechanism by which this effect comes about. Understanding how set size interacts with task-switching informs the debate regarding the relative contributions of bottom-up priming and top-down control processes in the development of cognitive flexibility. We tested two accounts for the relationship between set size and cognitive flexibility: the (bottom-up) Stimulus-Task Priming account and the (top-down) Rule Representation account. Our findings offered support for the Stimulus-Task Priming account, but not for the Rule Representation account. They suggest that children are susceptible to bottom-up priming caused by stimulus repetition, and that this priming can impair their ability to switch between tasks. These findings make important theoretical and practical contributions to the executive function literature: theoretically, they show that the basic features of a task exert a significant influence on children's ability to flexibly shift between tasks through bottom-up priming effects. Practically, they suggest that children's cognitive flexibility may have been underestimated relative to adults', as paradigms used with children typically have a smaller set size than those used with adults. These findings also have applications in education, where they have the potential to inform teaching in key areas where cognitive flexibility is required, such as mathematics and literacy.},

It is designed to allow the construction of as wide a variety of neuroscience experiments as possible, with the least effort. By writing scripts in standard Python syntax users can generate an enormous variety of visual and auditory stimuli and can interact with a wide range of external hardware (enabling its use in fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.). The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in demos or simulated neuroscience experiments. This paper describes the range of tools and stimuli that it provides and the environment in which experiments are conducted.},

  abstract = {The presence of a photopigment (melanopsin) within certain retinal ganglion cells was a surprising and significant discovery. This pigment is routinely described as ``nonvisual'' to highlight its signaling role in pupil dilation and circadian rhythms. Here we asked whether light absorbed by melanopsin can be seen by healthy human subjects. To answer this requires delivering intense (above rod saturation), well-controlled lights using four independent primaries. We collected detection thresholds to many four-primary stimuli. Threshold measurements in the fovea are explained by trichromatic theory, with no need to invoke a fourth photopigment. In the periphery, where melanopsin is present, threshold measurements deviate from trichromatic theory; at high photopic levels, sensitivity is explained by absorptions in four, not three, photopigment classes. We consider a series of hypotheses to explain the tetrasensitivity at high photopic levels in the human peripheral field. The most likely hypothesis is that in healthy human subjects melanopsin absorptions influence visibility.},

  abstract = {Shift in the wavelength of peak sensitivity of the cone photo pigments is a major cause of inter-individual variations in the Rayleigh match. Normal color observers performed multiple Rayleigh matches (i.e., a series of seven Rayleigh-type color matches using various sets of test and primary lights) in order to derive estimates of the M- and L-photo pigment wavelengths of maximum absorbance. We predicted the ratio of incident radiances Pr/Pg for a range of plausible values in terms of wavelength of the peak sensitivity of the M-cone and L-cone. An algorithm allowed us to adjust the values of the peak wavelength of the cone photo pigments in order to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted and real results of matches. To create candidate M-cone and L-cone photo pigments that best predict the set of equation values, we used the low density spectral absorbance curves of the M-cone and L-cone photo pigments respectively, as tabulated by Stockman and Sharpe (2000), and shifted each template along a logarithmic wavelength scale. For all observers, the system of seven Rayleigh-like equations converges to a unique solution. M- and L-cone photo pigments are estimated separately. The distribution of the wavelength of maximum sensitivity of the photo pigments includes a cluster. Only a few women's results lie outside the cluster. The choice of the template has a considerable influence on the convergence of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Primates are apparently unique amongst the mammals in possessing trichromatic colour vision. However, not all primates are trichromatic. Amongst the haplorhine (higher) primates, the catarrhines possess uniformly trichromatic colour vision, whereas most of the platyrrhine species exhibit polymorphic colour vision, with a variety of dichromatic and trichromatic phenotypes within the population.
It has been suggested that trichromacy in primates and the reflectance functions of certain tropical fruits are aspects of a coevolved seed\textendash{}dispersal system: primate colour vision has been shaped by the need to find coloured fruits amongst foliage, and the fruits themselves have evolved to be salient to primates and so secure dissemination of their seeds. We review the evidence for and against this hypothesis and we report an empirical test: we show that the spectral positioning of the cone pigments found in trichromatic South American primates is well matched to the task of detecting fruits against a background of leaves. We further report that particular trichromatic platyrrhine phenotypes may be better suited than others to foraging for particular fruits under particular conditions of illumination; and we discuss possible explanations for the maintenance of polymorphic colour vision amongst the platyrrhines.},

  abstract = {Summary
The illumination of a scene strongly affects our perception of~objects in that scene, e.g., the pages of a book illuminated by candlelight will appear quite yellow relative to other types of artificial illuminants. Yet at the same time, the reader still judges the pages as white, their surface color unaffected by~the interplay of paper and illuminant. It has been shown empirically [1] that we can indeed report two quite different interpretations of ``color'': one is dependent on the constant surface spectral reflectance of an object (surface color) and the other on the power of light of different wavelengths reflected from that object (reflected color). How then are these two representations related? The common view, dating from Aristotle, is that our experience of surface color is derived from reflected color or, in more familiar terms, that color perception follows from color sensation [2\textendash{}4]. By definition, color constancy requires that vision ``discounts the illuminant''; thus, it seems reasonable that vision begins with the color of objects as they naively appear and that we infer from their appearances their surface color. Here, we question this classic view. We use metacontrast-masked priming and, by presenting the unseen prime and the visible mask under different illuminants, dissociate two ways in which the prime matched the mask: in surface color or in reflected color. We find that priming of the mask occurs when it~matches the prime in surface color, not reflected color. It follows that color perception can arise without prior color sensation.},

  abstract = {Although many color constancy methods exist, they are all based on specific assumptions such as the set of possible light sources, or the spatial and spectral characteristics of images. As a consequence, no algorithm can be considered as universal. However, with the large variety of available methods, the question is how to select the method that induces equivalent classes for different image characteristics. Furthermore, the subsequent question is how to combine the different algorithms in a proper way. To achieve selection and combining of color constancy algorithms, in this paper, natural image statistics are used to identify the most important characteristics of color images. Then, based on these image characteristics, the proper color constancy algorithm (or best combination of algorithms) is selected for a specific image. To capture the image characteristics, the Weibull parameterization (e.g. texture and contrast) is used. Experiments show that, on a large data set of 11,000 images, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art single algorithms, as well as simple alternatives for combining several algorithms.},

The results show that Hunt's 91 model (developed to fit earlier experimental results) did not perform as well as it did in the previous studies using nontransmissive media. This implies that there are large differences in perceived colour appearance between transmissive and nontransmissive media viewing conditions.

Having obtained the data, they were used to test the accuracy of prediction for various colour spaces and models. The results clearly indicate that Hunt's 91 model gives the best fit to the visual results of all the models studied. Hunt's 91 has been further refined to improve the fit to the colourfulness results, and this refined model has been designated Hunt-ACAM (ACAM being the Alvey Colour Appearance Model). The error of prediction from Hunt-ACAM is close to the typical error that is seen to occur between individuals' results and the mean visual results. This performance is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model is therefore believed to provide a reasonably accurate way of evaluating colour fidelity for various colour reproduction systems. Various chromatic-adaptation transformations were also compared with three sets of corresponding chromaticities derived from the results of experiments conducted under four conditions of chromatic adaptation. The results are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by Helson et al. [Illum. Eng. 47, 221\textendash{}233 (1952)] and Lam and Rigg [Ph.D. thesis, University of Bradford (1985)]. All results indicate that the Bradford and Hunt-ACAM transformations perform the best and the second best, respectively, of all the selected formulae.

The aim of this project is to develop a colour appearance model capable of predicting changes of colour appearance under various different viewing conditions.

A large-scale experiment has been carried out in which colour appearance was assessed under a wide range of viewing conditions. The parameters studied were (1) D65, D50, white fluorescent, and tungsten light sources, (2) luminance levels of about 40 and 240 cd/m2, (3) five background conditions: white, grey, black, grey with white border, and grey with black border, and (4) two media: luminous colours (displayed on a high-resolution colour monitor) and nonluminous colours (presented in a viewing cabinet). Each colour was assessed by a panel of six or seven observers using a magnitude estimation method. In total, 43,332 estimations were made, and these form the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data. Data analysis has been carried out to examine the reliability of the experimental results and to understand the effects of the various viewing parameters studied.

  abstract = {In the mammalian retina, besides the conventional rod\textendash{}cone system, a melanopsin-associated photoreceptive system exists that conveys photic information for accessory visual functions such as pupillary light reflex and circadian photo-entrainment. On ablation of the melanopsin gene, retinal ganglion cells that normally express melanopsin are no longer intrinsically photosensitive. Furthermore, pupil reflex, light-induced phase delays of the circadian clock and period lengthening of the circadian rhythm in constant light are all partially impaired. Here, we investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate in these responses. Using mice lacking rods and cones, we measured the action spectrum for phase-shifting the circadian rhythm of locomotor behaviour. This spectrum matches that for the pupillary light reflex in mice of the same genotype, and that for the intrinsic photosensitivity of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. We have also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled with disabled rod and cone phototransduction mechanisms. These animals have an intact retina but fail to show any significant pupil reflex, to entrain to light/dark cycles, and to show any masking response to light. Thus, the rod\textendash{}cone and melanopsin systems together seem to provide all of the photic input for these accessory visual functions.},

Adaptation was maintained by a steady neutral background metameric to Illuminant D65. Thresholds varied substantially and systematically with the S-cone level of the target probes, but in a complex way: when the ratio of L:M cone excitation was low, an increase in S-cone excitation reduced the thresholds, but when the L:M ratio was higher, an increase in S-cone excitation raised the thresholds. To account for the pattern of results, we postulate a neural channel that draws synergistic inputs from L and S cones and an opposed input from M cones. The proposed channel has a compressive response function and is most sensitive at the point set by the steady background.},

He proposed that we can estimate the chromaticity of the illuminant in any scene because all surfaces reflect to us varying mixtures of (i) the body color and (ii) a specular component that represents the illuminant. He also realized that white objects have a special property: Provided that they are illuminated by a single illuminant, such objects exhibit no variation in chromaticity across their surface. Thus at least one of the unique hues exists as an external reference on which observers can agree. It is suggested that other unique hues may also have a basis in the external world.},

This investigation measured the loci of achromatic points for various intensities of a test field presented in a real rather than a simulated environment, lit by illuminants of various chromaticities. The achromatic point varied markedly with the intensity level of the test field: for dim test fields it was close to the surround chromaticity, but for high luminance test fields it was almost invariant with the surround chromaticity. The varying achromatic settings imply a variation in the relative effectiveness of the different cone types, but this variation originates in the postreceptoral system rather than at the photoreceptors themselves: flicker photometric sensitivity was almost independent of the illuminant in all cases. Nor does the variation take the simple form of a sensitivity-scaling coefficient; such a model can not predict the observed dependence of the achromatic setting on test intensity. The data could, however, be modeled with a scheme in which the log of the relative cone weight implicit in the achromatic setting depends almost linearly on (1) the log of the relative cone excitation by the illuminant and (2) the log of the test field intensity.},

The system is validated against an integrating sphere spectrometer using 22 pigments. Measurements were made on several Old Master drawings and one nineteenth-century watercolour. Results are reported for a watercolour by Eugene Louis Lami to illustrate application of the system. For a square object, 23970 individual reflection spectra are captured in a single scan resulting in file sizes of typically 115 MB. Software has been created that permits direct access, by on-screen selection, to the reflection spectrum of any given pixel in an image, reconstructed from the reflection data. PGP-type spectral scanning systems offer the advantage of potentially very high spectral resolutions of {$<$}0.5 nm, though the implementation here is for 5 nm resolution. Digital resolution across a square object is 512 \texttimes{} {$\sim$}50 for a PGP slit width of 80 {$\mu$}m. Details of the basic device construction, calibration and operation are provided. The system described here was designed for relatively low spatial resolution, although higher resolution can be achieved with modifications suggested in this publication.},

The setting up of parameters for material properties in light calculation software is done arbitrarily. We present a comparison between a real room and a digital model evaluated on a desktop PC and in an Immersive Projection Technology (IPT) type system. Data were collected from video recorded interviews and questionnaires. The participants assessed the appearance of light, colours and space. They also evaluated their involvement in solving this task, and their presence in each environment. Our results highlight the benefits and disadvantages of the real and virtual models. The participants had difficulties in estimating the size of both the desktop room and the room in the ITP system. The comparison of real and virtual rooms revealed unsatisfying differences in shadowing and colour appearance. We defined the magnitude of perceived colour reflections in the real room, and elaborated with some of the parameters in Lightscape/3dsmax6.},

In four repeated blocks, subjective reports, objective performance and physiological arousal were measured. Results showed effects of illuminance on subjective alertness and vitality, sustained attention in tasks, and heart rate and heart rate variability. Participants felt less sleepy and more energetic in the high versus the low lighting condition, had shorter reaction times on the psychomotor vigilance task and increased physiological arousal. Effects of illuminance on the subjective measures, as well as those on heart rate were not dependent on time of day or duration of exposure. Performance effects were most pronounced in the morning sessions and towards the end of the one-hour exposure period. The effect on heart rate variability was also most pronounced at the end of the one-hour exposure. The results demonstrate that even under normal, i.e., neither sleep nor light deprived conditions, more intense light can improve feelings of alertness and vitality, as well as objective performance and physiological arousal.},

1
Non-image forming, irradiance-dependent responses mediated by the human eye include synchronisation of the circadian axis and suppression of pineal melatonin production. The retinal photopigment(s) transducing these light responses in humans have not been characterised.

*
2
Using the ability of light to suppress nocturnal melatonin production, we aimed to investigate its spectral sensitivity and produce an action spectrum. Melatonin suppression was quantified in 22 volunteers in 215 light exposure trials using monochromatic light (30 min pulse administered at circadian time (CT) 16-18) of different wavelengths ({$\lambda$}max 424, 456, 472, 496, 520 and 548 nm) and irradiances (0.7-65.0 {$\mu$}W cm-2).

*
3
At each wavelength, suppression of plasma melatonin increased with increasing irradiance. Irradiance-response curves (IRCs) were fitted and the generated half-maximal responses (IR50) were corrected for lens filtering and used to construct an action spectrum.

*

The resulting action spectrum showed unique short-wavelength sensitivity very different from the classical scotopic and photopic visual systems. The lack of fit (r2 {$<$} 0.1) of our action spectrum with the published rod and cone absorption spectra precluded these photoreceptors from having a major role. Cryptochromes 1 and 2 also had a poor fit to the data. Fitting a series of Dartnall nomograms generated for rhodopsin-based photopigments over the {$\lambda$}max range 420-480 nm showed that rhodopsin templates between {$\lambda$}max 457 and 462 nm fitted the data well (r2{$\geq$} 0.73). Of these, the best fit was to the rhodopsin template with {$\lambda$}max 459 nm (r2= 0.74).

Our data strongly support a primary role for a novel short-wavelength photopigment in light-induced melatonin suppression and provide the first direct evidence of a non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive system in humans.},

  abstract = {The absolute and spectral sensitivities to light by the human circadian system, measured through melatonin suppression or phase shifting response, are beginning to emerge after a quarter century of active research. The present paper outlines a hypothesized model of human circadian phototransduction that is consistent with the known neuroanatomy and physiology of the human visual and circadian systems. Spectral opponency is fundamental to the model, providing a parsimonious explanation of some recently published data. The proposed model offers a framework for hypothesis testing and subsequent discussion of the practical aspects of architectural lighting with respect to light and health.},

  abstract = {An experiment was performed to: 1) Test the hypothesis that the ratio P*(S/P)0.5 can be used to predict the perception of spatial brightness, and 2) directly compare the rapid-sequential and side-by-side evaluation modes for assessing spatial brightness. The two evaluation modes produced comparable results. Though the side-by-side method has in the past been questioned by others, the data herein illustrates that it is neither faulty nor invalid. Red, green, and blue LEDs were employed to create four light settings that were permutations of two S/P ratios (1.7 and 2.6) and two luminance levels (24 and 30 cd/m2). The S/P ratios corresponded to the practical extremities of CCT (2900 and 7200 K) and were structured to have their chromaticity on the blackbody locus. At equal luminance there was no difference in the perception of brightness, irrespective of CCT. At unequal luminance, but when the ratio of P*(S/P)0.5 was set to 1:1, brightness perception was predicted by luminance. These data suggest that spatial brightness perceptions at photopic light levels are unrelated to the S/P ratio of the illumination. These results are consistent with the ``prime color'' theory of vision that is rooted in the trichromatic nature of human vision.},

The results showed that a correlated colour temperature around 3500 K, a negative deviation of the target from the blackbody locus and a high colour rendering index can achieve satisfactory results. The difference between colour fidelity-based colour rendering indices and colour preference-based colour rendering indices for a museum application was also explored.},

It is still unknown, however, whether the spectral sensitivity of the circadian system also changes throughout the solar day. Reported here is a new study that was designed to determine whether the spectral sensitivity of the circadian retinal phototransduction mechanism, measured through melatonin suppression and iris constriction, varies at night.},

  abstract = {Major factors to be considered when designing lighting for paintings include colour discrimination, colour diversity, clarity and the balance of cool\textendash{}warm (bluish-yellowish) lighting. This paper concerns the last factor and presents two radiometric and one colorimetric methods of predicting cool\textendash{}warm balanced illuminants. For a high correlated colour temperature, the spectral power distributions of Planckian and daylight-simulating illuminants are high in short wavelengths and low in long wavelengths and, therefore, appear bluish. The reverse is true for low correlated colour temperature illuminants, which appear yellowish. The balanced spectral power distribution occurs at 5000 K. MacAdam's complementary powers function is psychophysical and represents the power of wavelengths across the visible spectrum required to neutralize (convert to white) their complementaries. Again the balanced power occurs for illuminants of 5000 K. Hence, a correlated colour temperature in the 4500\textendash{}5500 K range is recommended for cool\textendash{}warm balanced illuminants. This recommendation is supported by results of four recent experimental studies.},

  abstract = {This paper provides recommendations for optimum LED light spectra in shop environments. The main aspects of the research were to elaborate the optimal LED spectral power distribution for the lighting of different colour textiles, fruits and vegetables, meat and bakery products. The spectrum was tailored towards different colour quality metrics such as the colour rendering index and the colour quality scale. Small scale investigations with eye-tracker studies were carried out by Osram Opto Semiconductors at the University of Regensburg and full scale experiments were conducted at the University of Pannonia during the project in order to determine which metric correlates best to the preference of the observers. Results of the psychophysical have been evaluated with the help of analytic hierarchy process and a modified Thurstone method. As a result of the investigation, optimal spectral power distributions for shop environment are described.},

  abstract = {Past studies have shown that the Feeling of Contrast Index (FCI) correlates with preference in some circumstances, but the exact relationship is not clear and may differ among visual conditions and targets. This paper presents a psychophysical experiment in which 70 observers evaluated the colour quality of natural objects under different spectral power distributions with different values of FCI but the same correlated colour temperature (3000 and 5000 K). Results show that FCI holds a nearly perfect linear correlation with vividness (r = 0.976); unnaturalness associated with enhanced vividness rendered by excessively high FCI deteriorates preference. These effects are independent of correlated colour temperatures, but are dependent upon the visual targets used because of limitations in the derivation of FCI. Compared to other metrics, FCI can characterise vividness under a light source.},

Stable inferences about surface color might be supported by spatial ratios of cone excitations from the reflected light, but their invariance has been quantified only for global changes in illuminant spectrum. The aim here was to test their invariance under natural changes in both illumination spectrum and geometry, especially in the distribution of shadows. Time-lapse hyperspectral radiance images were acquired from five outdoor vegetated and nonvegetated scenes. From each scene, 10,000 pairs of points were sampled randomly and ratios measured across time. Mean relative deviations in ratios were generally large, but when sampling was limited to short distances or moderate time intervals, they fell below the level for detecting violations in ratio invariance. When illumination changes with uneven geometry were excluded, they fell further, to levels obtained with global changes in illuminant spectrum alone. Within sampling constraints, ratios of cone excitations, and also of opponent-color combinations, provide an approximately invariant signal for stable surface-color inferences, despite spectral and geometric variations in scene illumination.},

Unlike the changes in time and their consequences for color appearance and constancy, the spatial variations of local illumination color in natural scenes have received relatively little attention. The aim of the present work was to characterize these spatial variations by spectral imaging. Hyperspectral radiance images were obtained from 30 rural and urban scenes in which neutral probe spheres were embedded. The spectra of the local illumination at 17 sample points on each sphere in each scene were extracted and a total of 1904 chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperatures (CCTs) derived. Maximum differences in chromaticities over spheres and over scenes were similar. When data were pooled over scenes, CCTs ranged from 3000 K to 20,000 K, a variation of the same order of magnitude as that occurring over the day. Any mechanisms that underlie stable surface color perception in natural scenes need to accommodate these large spatial variations in local illumination color.},

  abstract = {Conservation-based restrictions on light levels and cumulative exposure in museum galleries are now well established. These have resulted in restrictions on the use of daylight and prolonged development of systems to deliver and control its admittance. Attempts to control daylight and deliver fixed illuminance levels have proved difficult to sustain. Recent installations, in the 1980s and 1990s, have become reliant on a proportion of electric lighting during most opening hours and an acceptance of limited daylight variability within dosage recommendations. Given the difficulties in estimating and measuring dosage, most museums have limited data on their actual lighting performance, and guidance is sparse on how such targets can be met. This paper reviews the limited goals widely referred to in guidance to designers and presents typical data drawn from monitoring in the Frick Collection, New York. The balance between electric light and daylight is discussed in the context of an interior's daylit sensibility, and this provides the basis for a proposed widening of criteria for lighting performance in museum galleries.},

We have carried out the spectral and colorimetric characterization of some paintings located in the Murcielagos (bats) cave (Zuheros, C{\~A}{\^A}{$^3$}rdoba, Spain). From this characterization, the chromatic changes produced under different lighting conditions are analysed. The damage function is also computed for the different illuminants used. From the results obtained, it is proposed an illuminant whose spectral distribution diminishes the damage by minimizing the absorption of radiation and optimises the color perception of the paintings in this cave. The procedure followed in this study can be applied to optimise the lighting systems used when illuminating any other art work},

  abstract = {Display lighting which enhances object appearance may be legitimate for many museum exhibits, but is generally inappropriate for works of art. These require presentation which reveals their intrinsic visible characteristics with accuracy and honesty, and the term 'exhibition' is used to distinguish this process from display. It requires that the entire setting, including lighting, develops from an aim to reveal works of art rather than to enhance them, and the notion of 'the well-lit room' is promoted as a concept which expresses the essentials of this design approach. However, it is evident that these may conflict with recommended illuminance maxima, particularly the 50 lux level for more sensitive objects. A working model of the photochemical processes is proposed to give an improved basis for specifying control of lighting. Limiting values of annual damage exposure are derived from the current illuminance maxima recommendations; these permit a more flexible approach to reconciling competing requirements for exhibition and conservation. Also, the model provides a framework which enables information relating to exposure of materials and to means for controlling degradation to be evaluated in terms which can readily be related to actual conditions of exhibition m museums and art galleries.},

Here, we investigate perceptual responses under illumination from two sources, a blue-pumped LED with a colour rendering index of 85 (BLED85), and a violet-pumped LED with a colour rendering index of 97 (VLED97). Forty-eight participants completed three experiments. Neutral, red, and pink were preferred under VLED97. Skin rendition was preferred by Caucasians under VLED97; Asians had no preference. Teeth and a white shirt were whiter and more preferred under VLED97. We conclude that the colour and whiteness rendition must be considered on a par with luminous efficacy.},

Twenty-four observers of different gender and educational background participated to evaluate oil and gouache paintings under different lighting conditions. Each painting was assessed via 14 word pairs using the categorical judgment method. The results showed that illuminance had a larger impact than CCT on visual perception, and three factors dominate visual perceptions: Comfort, Vividness and Definition. The present results only partially agreed with Kruithof's rule. A comfort zone of illuminance and CCT for paintings in museums has been developed.},

  shorttitle = {Chromatic {{Pupil Responses}}},
  abstract = {Objective
To weight the rod-, cone-, and melanopsin-mediated activation of the retinal ganglion cells, which drive the pupil light reflex by varying the light stimulus wavelength, intensity, and duration.
Design
Experimental study.
Participants
Forty-three subjects with normal eyes and 3 patients with neuroretinal visual loss.
Methods
A novel stimulus paradigm was developed using either a long wavelength (red) or short wavelength (blue) light given as a continuous Ganzfeld stimulus with stepwise increases over a 2 log-unit range. The pupillary movement before, during, and after the light stimulus was recorded in real time with an infrared illuminated video camera.
Main Outcome Measures
The percent pupil contraction of the transient and sustained pupil response to a low- (1 cd/m2), medium- (10 cd/m2), and high-intensity (100 cd/m2) red- and blue-light stimulus was calculated for 1 eye of each subject. From the 43 normal eyes, median and 25th, 75th, 5th, and 95th percentile values were obtained for each stimulus condition.
Results
In normal eyes at lower intensities, blue light evoked much greater pupil responses compared with red light when matched for photopic luminance. The transient pupil contraction was generally greater than the sustained contraction, and this disparity was greatest at the lowest light intensity and least apparent with bright (100 cd/m2) blue light. A patient with primarily rod dysfunction (nonrecordable scotopic electroretinogram) showed significantly reduced pupil responses to blue light at lower intensities. A patient with achromatopsia and an almost normal visual field showed selective reduction of the pupil response to red-light stimulation. A patient with ganglion cell dysfunction owing to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy demonstrated global loss of pupil responses to red and blue light in the affected eye.
Conclusions
Pupil responses that differ as a function of light intensity and wavelength support the hypothesis that selected stimulus conditions can produce pupil responses that reflect phototransduction primarily mediated by rods, cones, or melanopsin. Use of chromatic pupil responses may be a novel way to diagnose and monitor diseases affecting either the outer or inner retina.

  abstract = {Lights vary in their ability to render object spectral reflectances into color contrasts. When a light L1 is replaced by another L2, even if L2 matches L1 in chromaticity, systematic color shifts may occur, including a loss or gain of chromatic color. For instance, many familiar lights, when compared to daylight, dull red and green objects, rendering them closer to gray. An opponent colors method is appropriate to this discussion because it brings to the surface the notion of chromatic color, meaning actual departure from white or gray. In this article, an opponent-colors analysis leads to a matrix formulation that serves two purposes. The effects of replacing L1 by L2 are estimated with a 3\texttimes{}3 ``rendering matrix'' P. Given an object's tristimulus vector under L1, the method makes an approximate prediction of the new tristimulus vector under L2. Thanks to the opponent formulation, matrix element P22 quantifies the gain or loss of redness and greenness, while P33 expresses gain or loss of blueness and yellowness. These in fact are major effects, so the method is both quantitative and explanatory. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  volume = {8790},
  abstract = {Saint Rocco Museum, a historical building in Venice, Italy is used as a case study to explore the performance of its' lighting system and visible light impact on viewing the large size art works. The transition from threedimensional architectural rendering to the three-dimensional virtual luminance mapping and visualization within a virtual environment is described as an integrated optical method for its application toward preservation of the cultural heritage of the space. Lighting simulation programs represent color as RGB triplets in a devicedependent color space such as ITU-R BT709. Prerequisite for this is a 3D-model which can be created within this computer aided virtual environment. The onsite measured surface luminance, chromaticity and spectral data were used as input to an established real-time indirect illumination and a physically based algorithms to produce the best approximation for RGB to be used as an input to generate the image of the objects. Conversion of RGB to and from spectra has been a major undertaking in order to match the infinite number of spectra to create the same colors that were defined by RGB in the program. The ability to simulate light intensity, candle power and spectral power distributions provide opportunity to examine the impact of color inter-reflections on historical paintings. VR offers an effective technique to quantify the visible light impact on human visual performance under precisely controlled representation of light spectrum that could be experienced in 3D format in a virtual environment as well as historical visual archives. The system can easily be expanded to include other measurements and stimuli.},

Three different light-emitting diode spectral power distribution, all at correlated colour temperatures of 2800 K, 4000 K and 6500 K, were simulated for Ra {$>$} 90, Ra {$\approx$} 80 and Ra {$<$} 60. It was found that CIE CRI, CQS and CRI2012 were highly correlated with visual colour difference. It was also found that colour quality scale provides better prediction for the light-emitting diode light source that highly increases object chroma. However, more colour fidelity experiments using light-emitting diode light sources that highly increase object chroma are required before recommending any final colour fidelity metric.},

As a first step toward testing whether light source spectrum choices\textemdash{}which are possible with light emitting diode (LED) systems\textemdash{}offer similar benefits, we examined preferences for various spectra in a scale model of an office. Participants judged the model's brightness, colorfulness, and pleasantness when lit with five preset spectra with measured correlated color temperatures (CCTs) of 2855, 3728, 4751, 5769, and 6507 K created with five LED channels and one fluorescent spectrum (3750 K measured), all at approximately 500 lx. Then they chose their preferred light spectrum using the five LED channels, once as a free choice and once with an illuminance limit. Judgments of the fluorescent spectrum and the LED spectrum with the closest (matched) CCT did not differ. The preset judgments followed a quadratic pattern, with the lowest and highest CCT conditions having lower ratings than the three middle conditions. The free and illuminance-constrained lighting choices did not differ, with individuals' selections ranging from 2850 to 14,000 K and generally lying slightly below the blackbody curve.},

  abstract = {A psychophysical experiment was conducted to investigate brightness perception and color preference under illumination from typical 3000 K blue-pumped light emitting diode (LED) A19 lamps (BP-LED) and 3000 K blue-pumped LED A19 lamps with diminished yellow emission (YD-LED). Eighty-seven participants between 19 and 25 years completed brightness matching and preference comparisons between two full-size side-by-side rooms that contained chromatic objects and still life arrangements, with one lamp type in each room. Participants had higher overall preference to the room illuminated by YD-LED. Specifically, red, green, orange, and wood objects were preferred under YD-LED; no preference was found for neutral, yellow, and blue objects between the two lamp types. The words saturated, vivid, vibrant, pleasant, inviting, colorful, stand-out, distinct, appealing, and comfortable were reported as reasons for the color preference under YD-LED; dull, dead, and fade were used by participants to describe the lower color preference under BP-LED. Skin tone preference under the illumination of these two lamp types was significantly different between Asian (n = 32) and Caucasian (n = 52) participants. Caucasians evaluated their own skin tone more favorably under YD-LED, with the average assessment that skin appeared healthy and colorful under YD-LED but grey and pale under BP-LED. No preference between the two lamps was found among Asians for their skin tone, though some Asians thought YD-LED rendered their skin too red and odd. Many existing measures of color preference and gamut were able to predict the higher overall preference to YD-LED, but they could not predict the preference of specific colors or for ethnic groups. The higher saturation and preference for red and green colors under YD-LED illumination is consistent with the higher red\textendash{}green opponent signal provided by YD-LED. Coupled with several past studies, the spectral region around 570\textendash{}580 nm appears to be deleterious to color and brightness perception.},

  abstract = {The determination of the long-term memory colours of objects has been the subject of investigation for many years. Colour acceptance boundaries have been determined from the visual assessments of objects under variable illumination or by presenting manipulated images of objects on a calibrated computer display. However, a systematic and quantitative rating of the colour of real objects with respect to memory colour is not available at this moment. In this article, nine familiar real objects with colours distributed around the hue circle were positioned in a specially designed LED illumination box. For each object, approximately hundred real illumination spectra were synthesized in a random order keeping the luminance of the object approximately constant. Observers were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the similarity of the perceived object colour to their idea of what the object looked like in reality. By avoiding specular reflections, the observer was unable to identify any clues as to the colour of the illumination. For each object, similarity ratings showed a good intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The ratings of all the observers were pooled and successfully modeled in IPT colour space by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. It was found that the chromaticity corresponding to the highest rating tended to be shifted toward higher chroma in comparison with the chromaticity calculated under D65 illumination. The bivariate distributions could be very useful in applications where the quantitative evaluation of the colour appearance of an object stimulus is required, such as in the evaluation of the colour rendering capabilities of a light source. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The CIE color rendering (fidelity) index (CRI) has remained unchanged for over four decades. Most, if not all, of its components could be updated to more state-of-the-art methods. One of the most critical components of any color rendering (fidelity) metric is the test sample selection. This article therefore addresses the importance of uniform sampling of wavelength space to avoid selective optimization\textemdash{}that is, taking advantage of the unequal contributions of different wavelength regions to the general color rendering score\textemdash{}of light source spectral power distributions. It summarizes the development of a mathematical sample set with undistorted spectral sensitivity, the HL17 set. The set is used in a recently proposed update, the CRI2012 general color rendering index. To assess the impact of the spectrally uniform sample set on color fidelity scores, the CRI2012 index values for each of a set of 139 lamps were compared with those of the CIE CRI. In addition, the impact of updating the other components was investigated. A mean and maximum absolute difference of respectively 5.9 and 21.8 index units were found between the CRI2012 and CIE CRI, although the largest part\textemdash{}respectively 4.03 and 19.7 index units\textemdash{}was shown to be the result of updating the color difference engine and the switch to the CIE 10\textdegree{} observer. The analysis also indicated possible past spectral selective optimization of some warm-white tri-band fluorescent sources for high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) and (just) sufficient CIE Ra values by taking advantage of the spectral nonuniformity of the CIE reflectance set. Adopting a spectrally uniform sample set in a color rendering metric therefore has important practical implications when designing light source spectra. Finally, possible updates and further improvements of the CRI2012 are briefly mentioned.},

It has been theorized that there may be a large amount of overlap between the neural representations of these objects and processing involved in color perception. In accordance with this theory we sought to determine if the recognition of highly color diagnostic fruit objects could be facilitated by the visual presentation of their known color associates. In two experiments we show that color associate priming is possible, but contingent upon multiple factors. Color priming was found to be maximally effective for the most highly color diagnostic fruits, when low spatial-frequency information was present in the image, and when determination of the object's specific identity, not merely its category, was required. These data illustrate the importance of color for determining the identity of certain objects, and support the theory that object knowledge involves sensory specific systems.},

  abstract = {Traditional color appearance modeling has recently matured to the point that available, internationally recommended models such as CIECAM02 are capable of making a wide range of predictions, to within the observer variability in color matching and color scaling of stimuli, in somewhat simplified viewing conditions. It is proposed that the next significant advances in the field of color appearance modeling and image quality metrics will not come from evolutionary revisions of colorimetric color appearance models alone. Instead, a more revolutionary approach will be required to make appearance and difference predictions for more complex stimuli in a wider array of viewing conditions. Such an approach can be considered image appearance modeling, since it extends the concepts of color appearance modeling to stimuli and viewing environments that are spatially and temporally at the level of complexity of real natural and man-made scenes, and extends traditional image quality metrics into the color appearance domain. Thus, two previously parallel and evolving research areas are combined in a new way as an attempt to instigate a significant advance. We review the concepts of image appearance modeling, present iCAM as one example of such a model, and provide a number of examples of the use of iCAM in image reproduction and image quality evaluation. \textcopyright{} 2004 SPIE and IS\&T.},

Among the many transforms tested, this transform gave the most accurate predictions to a number of experimental data sets.

  abstract = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode\textendash{}based sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to span 0\textendash{}100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

The output spectral irradiance or radiance of the source will be calibrated by a reference instrument, and the source will be used as a spectroradiometric as well as a photometric and colorimetric standard. A series of simulations have been conducted to predict the performance of the designed tunable source when used for calibration of display colorimeters. The results indicate that the errors can be reduced by an order of magnitude when the tunable source is used to calibrate the colorimeters, compared with measurement errors when the colorimeters are calibrated against Illuminant A.

Some methods are based on the shape of the spectral output of the source, considering broadband sources to have better color rendering than sources with spectral peaks or valleys. Several proposals share the basic method of CRI, with modifications to improve performance. Still other ideas are based on measures of the gamut area of rendered object colors.

  abstract = {Most descriptions of the color rendering properties of light sources are based on the calculation of color differences for a number of reflectance samples between the light source and a reference source. The CIE color rendering index (CRI) is a single number based on the average color difference for eight reflectance samples. Since its introduction, the CRI has been discussed at length and many alternatives have been suggested to improve the description of color rendering. These metrics comprise among others, metrics based on color fidelity, color gamut, and color preference and combinations of these. All of these new proposals try to capture a certain color rendering aspect in a single number index to be used instead of or together with the existing CIE CRI. The ``traditional'' CRI has been criticized due to the fact that a single number index does not provide sufficient information about the color rendering properties of light sources. Creating a (second) single number metric seems to be a bit of a paradox, because it suffers from the same limitation by providing an average number to characterize certain color aspects for all colors. In our view, the best way to provide users of lighting in whatever application with accurate information on color characteristics is to provide specific information on the most important color characteristics such as hue, chroma, and lightness. In this article, we describe our methods of supplying hue-specific information via color rendering vectors and color rendering icons. We illustrate why we believe that it is important to add hue-specific information and what the shortcomings are of a second hue-averaged metric. We acknowledge that color appearance models have advanced since our first calculations and that it would be more appropriate to use CIECAM02. In addition, several recent papers have appeared discussing improved reflectance sample sets. These advancements, however, do not change the key message in this article, which advocates the use of graphics to communicate shifts in hue and chroma.},

For instance, calculation of t{\^i} and d{\^i} for daylight shows that on a gray day, color contrasts are actually reduced. By these measures, many common vapor-discharge illuminants systematically distort object colors. Because red-green contrasts contribute to border distinctness, and both types of color contrast contribute to brightness, such systematic distortions probably affect the overall clarity and brightness of what is perceived visually. Experimental data are consistent with this idea.In relation to color-constancy (retinex) experiments, it is approximately true that the visual system discounts the color of an illuminant but not its t{\^i} and d{\^i}.},

The aim for lighting and conservation of museum objects is defined as satisfying viewers with the least possible amount of energy being absorbed by the displayed object. Current standards and recommended practices are reviewed, and it is concluded that museum lighting policies should be directed towards control of non-visible irradiance, both IR and uv, and that future research should move beyond examining fading effects of exposure to studying ways to satisfy viewers with minimum absorbed energy.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {1477-1535, 1477-0938},
  abstract = {The original experimental work of CIE to establish a method for assessing the colour rendering properties of light sources has been analysed. The spectral power distribution of the Standard Warm White fluorescent lamp, used in that experiment to define a General Colour Rendering Index (Ra) equal to 50, is presented with extended spectral range and resolution. This lamp was used to compute new Ra indices when the CIE(1964)UVW formula was substituted by the CIELUV or the new, improved SVF colour space formula. Ten fluorescent and discharge lamps and two extra sets of colour samples were included in this investigation. The Special Colour Rendering Indices (Ri) for each sample of a set of 24 saturated colours show large deviations when the UVW formula is substituted by the SVF formula. Less variation is seen for the averaged Ra indices. However, for the Warm White de Luxe lamp investigated by the CIE committee, only the SVF formula yields a Ra index equal to that obtained by visual rating. The SVF formula includes a correction for chromatic adaptation that correlates well with physiological data. This improved adaptation transform makes it possible to use daylight illumination as a fixed reference source. This leads to drastic changes of the Ra-values, mainly due to a systematic degradation of Ra with decreasing correlated colour temperature. It is suggested that the use of the SVF formula, in combination with a set of 20 colour samples of constant lightness and saturation and with hues evenly distributed along the colour circle, will lead to an improved colour rendering index, tentatively called the Rb index. Our investigations indicate that, compared to the present CIE Ra index, only minor changes will result for the Standard, de Luxe and broad-band type of lamps. For modern energy saving lamps with irregular spectral power distribution, however, like three-three-band and most of the discharge lamps, the Rb index may deviate significantly and lead to more realistic values.},

  abstract = {Two white lights may have the same chromaticity, and yet when used to light an array of objects may differ in their ability to reveal colors. For example, any white light can be matched by a mixture of two narrow-band lights, a yellow plus a blue. In this extreme case, reds and greens become black or brown and the red-green dimension is lost. At the other extreme, a light with three narrow bands, at the proper wavelengths, can brighten reds and greens and increase red-green contrast, relative to a broad-band light such as daylight. Many commercial lights tend to dull reds and greens, relative to broad-band sources, a central reason that color rendering is a practical concern. A telling example is neodymium glass, a yellow-absorbing filter that is sometimes used to improve color rendering. This article seeks to bring these ideas to life through detailed graphical examples. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The visual clarity of a lighting environment is significantly affected by changing the general color rendering index (Ra) of its illumination. This effect has been studied by a number of researchers, but the cause of this effect has not been thoroughly studied. In order to clarify this, the mutual relations between visual clarity, lightness perception, and feeling of contrast are analyzed by using object colors under illuminations with various Ra values. the results obtained are as follows. (1) the visual clarity of a lighting environment is different from the lightness perception of the object colors in the environment. (2) the change in visual clarity of a lighting environment is highly correlated to a feeling of contrast between object colors under the illumination. (3) the effect of visual clarity is estimated effectively by assessing the feeling of contrast using a specially selected four-color combination. (4) the illuminance for equal visual clarity for any illumination is predicted by the equality of feeling of contrast under the same illumination specified by the gamut area made by the component colors of the four-color combination in a brightness and colorfulness space. (5) the effect of visual clarity under various illuminations cannot be predicted by using their Ra values.},

Though this is not as extreme as suggesting that we should live in cold darkness, it is in the same general direction of deprivation.Yet research has shown that color rendering is important to people and high-efficiency lamps can now also provide high color rendering, so there is no longer any need to have lighting that distorts color appearance. This article focuses on the tradeoff between color rendering accuracy and lamp efficiency to show that high color rendering accuracy is appropriate and, contrary to a common misconception, does not intrinsically require greater electrical energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Artificial lighting allows humans to be active at night, but has many unintended consequences, including interference with ecological processes, disruption of circadian rhythms and increased exposure to insect vectors of diseases. Although ultraviolet and blue light are usually most attractive to arthropods, degree of attraction varies among orders. With a focus on future indoor lighting applications, we manipulated the spectrum of white lamps to investigate the influence of spectral composition on number of arthropods attracted. We compared numbers of arthropods captured at three customizable light-emitting diode (LED) lamps (3510, 2704 and 2728 K), two commercial LED lamps (2700 K), two commercial compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs; 2700 K) and a control. We configured the three custom LEDs to minimize invertebrate attraction based on published attraction curves for honeybees and moths. Lamps were placed with pan traps at an urban and two rural study sites in Los Angeles, California. For all invertebrate orders combined, our custom LED configurations were less attractive than the commercial LED lamps or CFLs of similar colour temperatures. Thus, adjusting spectral composition of white light to minimize attracting nocturnal arthropods is feasible; not all lights with the same colour temperature are equally attractive to arthropods.},

  abstract = {The availability of electric lighting has changed the lives of people the world over, yet as a major user of electricity it has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. This scrutiny has focused largely on the environmental consequences, with little consideration of the benefits of lighting. Human Factors in Lighting, Third Edition restores some balance to the discussion by examining the ways in which people interact with lighting. These interactions influence the ability to perform visual tasks; the perception of people, objects, and spaces; human comfort and behavior; as well as human health and safety. It is only by understanding how to use light to achieve these ends that lighting can be provided effectively and efficiently to the benefit of all. See What's New in the Third Edition:   New chapters on the non-image-forming system, lighting for pedestrians, light pollution, and lighting and electricity use  Revision of all other chapters to update them to take into account the advances that have been made in our understanding of the effects of light on people over the last decade  Integration of the combined effects of light via the visual and non-image-forming systems on performance and perception   The book covers both the visual and the non-visual effects of light on people as well as the benefits of lighting and the costs it imposes on the environment. It details the consequences of exposure to lighting or lighting technology and the role of exposure to light on such basic functions of the body as circadian rhythms. The author combines information from many different sources and integrates them into a coherent overview of lighting practice that can be used to develop better lighting solutions at a lower environmental cost.},

In 1992, at the Asilomar Conference Centre, visual scientists and psychologists met with linguists and anthropologists for the first time to examine how these claims have fared in the light of current knowledge. To what extent can cross-cultural regularities be explained by the operation of the human visual system? What can the study of colour categorisation tell us about concept formation? Are the Berlin-Kay results an artifact of their methods? What tools have been and should be used to probe the structure of human colour categories? In this volume, which arose from that conference but also incorporates new work, a distinguished team of contributors survey key ideas, results and techniques from the study of human colour vision, as well as field methods and theoretical interpretations drawn from linguistic anthropology.},

  title = {Individual Colorimetric Observers for Personalized Color Imaging},
  copyright = {Copyright ProQuest Dissertations Publishing 2015},
  abstract = {Colors are typically described by three values such as RGB, XYZ, and HSV. This is rooted to the fact that humans possess three types of photoreceptors under photopic conditions, and human color vision can be characterized by a set of three color matching functions (CMFs). CMFs integrate spectra to produce three colorimetric values that are related to visual responses. In reality, large variations in CMFs exist among color-normal populations. Thus, a pair of two spectrally different stimuli might be a match for one person but a mismatch for another person, also known as observer metamerism.
Observer metamerism is a serious issue in color-critical applications such as soft proofing in graphic arts and color grading in digital cinema, where colors are compared on different displays. Due to observer metamerism, calibrated displays might not appear correctly, and one person might disagree with color adjustments made by another person. The recent advent of wide color gamut display technologies (e.g., LEDs, OLEDs, lasers, and Quantum Dots) has made observer metamerism even more serious due to their spectrally narrow primaries. The variations among normal color vision and observer metamerism have been overlooked for many years. The current typical color imaging workflow uses a single standard observer assuming all the color-normal people possess the same CMFs. This dissertation provides a possible solution for observer metamerism in color-critical applications by personalized color imaging introducing individual colorimetric observers.
In this dissertation, at first, color matching data were collected to derive and validate CMFs for individual colorimetric observers. The data from 151 color-normal observers were obtained at four different locations. Second, two types of individual colorimetric observer functions were derived and validated. One is an individual colorimetric observer model, an extension of the CIE 2006 physiological observer incorporating eight physiological parameters to model individuals in addition to age and field size inputs. The other is a set of categorical observer functions providing a more convenient approach towards the personalized color imaging. Third, two workflows were proposed to characterize human color vision: one using a nomaloscope and the other using proposed spectral pseudoisochromatic images. Finally, the personalized color imaging was evaluated in a color image matching study on an LCD monitor and a laser projector and in a perceived color difference study on a SHARP Quattron display. The personalized color imaging was implemented using a newly introduced ICC profile, iccMAX.},

  shorttitle = {Art in a New Light},
  abstract = {The purpose of this research is to design the best lighting that will minimize long term photochemical degradation of Old Master Drawings and/or other works of art, while maintaining the patron's appreciation of the object's color and detail. The present approach is a technological refinement to the basic underlying earlier work on fluorescent lighting by W. A. Thornton, W.A. at General Electric1. Thin-film dielectric, multi-coating technology is used to create filters that eliminate ultraviolet light, near infrared light and significant unnecessary parts from the visible spectrum, thus maximizing the reduction in photochemical degradation, while maintaining optimal color rendering. Three interference filters, were designed and manufactured successfully. The filters are designated Mark 1, Mark 2, \& Mark 3. In this dissertation, the filters are analyzed with regard to their performance parameters. This includes color rendering, retardation in fading or color change, beam angle effects, filter stability, perceived brightness, and visual appreciation parameters.
To a high confidence level, all three filters are perceived as being indistinguishable from Unfiltered light with regard to the color confusion index parameter (CCI). Subjective assessments by tests subjects suggest the Mark 3 filter may display some distinguishability with a confidence level for distinguishability of 35\% for the overall satisfaction parameter. The Mark 3 filter is the most complex three-color type spectral profile and this might be expected due to beam angle effects or departures in accuracy of color theory. Beam angle affects suggest that the Mark 1 and Mark 2 filters do not display significant color rendering aberrations due to Newton's colors interference effects, except possibly at the periphery of the broadest (55-60+\textdegree{}) beam angle lamps.
Filtered and Unfiltered light are effectively of the same perceived brightness, though to a low confidence level, Unfiltered light might be perceived brighter. Accelerated aging studies of the filters indicate useful mean time before failures of {$>$}20 years. In fact, no failure was observed in any of the accelerated studies, The Mark 2 and Mark 3 filters were evaluated in equal-luminosity studies with regard to their effect on limiting fading of both standard fading samples such as the ISO Blue Wool series, and also other commercial pigments or stains. Within experimental error, the Mark 2 filter either slowed fading or had no effect on fading for all pigments relative to Unfiltered light and Optivex\textregistered{} filtered light, Optivex\textregistered{} being a common commercial filter used to protect works of art. Mark 3 protected in many cases, but for some pigments it was less protective than Optivex\textregistered{} filtered light. This failure is interpreted in terms of the wavelength dependence of the excess light in certain wavelength regions on an equal luminosity condition, and suggests that more subtle wavelength dependent optimizations have to be undertaken for filters which possess significant band separation.},

Each colour was assessed by a panel of five observers using a magnitude estimation method under three light sources, D65, TL84, and A. In total, 10,770 estimations were made, and these form a set of new colour appearance data in textiles. Data analysis was carried out and shows that the accuracy of the visual results for different observers is quite good. the colour appearance data were used to test the performance of seven chromatic-adaptation transformations, i.e., BFD, Bartleson, von Kries, CIE, Hunt, CIEL*a*b*, and Fairchild. the results show that the BFD transformation gives the most accurate prediction to the visual results between all transformations studied. All transformations can have a better fit to the experimental grid under TL84 than that under A. However, the results given by the best chromatic-adaptation transformation are still unsatisfied in colour industries, especially in the textile industry. the two sets of experimental grids respectively derived from this work and by Luo et al. (1991) were also studied. an expected difference between the two sets of experimental grids was found. the difference may mainly result from two factors: the experimental method in assessment and the size of the samples. \textcopyright{} 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  volume = {2014},
  abstract = {The authors propose a method of image rendering to predict the incomplete chromatic-adaptation effect for paintings. A simple model of incomplete chromatic adaptation is developed to predict the appearance of the paintings under the illumination of an incandescent light source and to produce the full color image on a display device. The authors extend the von Kries framework to incomplete chromatic adaptation. An index parameter representing the degree of incomplete chromatic adaptation is defined based on the color temperature of the black-body radiators. First, the optimum value of the index parameter is determined by visual experiments on memory matching using real paintings and color patches, so that the color image produced on the display is matched to the original appearance of objects in a real scene. This approach is shown to have better performance in comparison with the traditional CIECAM02. Next, an algorithm is presented to estimate the index parameter of the incomplete adaptation index based on the image data of colorimetric rendering for a target painting. It is found that the index parameter can be estimated using only three features extracted from the color image. The color images rendered with the estimated parameter are used to predict the incomplete chromatic-adaptation effect for the original painting under the incandescent light source. The feasibility of the proposed method is confirmed based on a series of experiments using a variety of paintings. \textcopyright{} 2014 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

Besides a simultaneous presentation of standard and test illuminants, we also carried out an experiment in which the illuminants were presented successively. The results were similar to Arend and Reeves's; however, in the object-matching condition of the successive experiment, we found an overestimation, instead of an underestimation, of the illuminant component. Because the results of matching experiments are difficult to interpret, mainly due to their sensitivity to instruction effects, we introduced another type of color-constancy task. In this task, subjects simply named the color of a simulated patch. It was found that, by applying such a task, a reliable measure of the degree of identification of object color can be obtained.},

  volume = {12},
  issn = {1550-2724},
  abstract = {Recently, a group including the present authors developed a new color rendering (fidelity) measure, approved by the IES and henceforth referred to as IES Rf, that has two major updates with respect to the general color rendering index Ra of the CIE. First, it proposes an update to the more perceptually uniform CAM02-UCS color space. Secondly, instead of using only a small number (eight) of moderately saturated samples to determine a general color fidelity index, the IES method proposes using a set of 99 samples uniformly distributed in color space. In addition to the latter, the sample set has one other important property: spectral uniformity. This ensures that the sample set is not wavelength biased: all wavelengths contribute equivalently to the general color fidelity score. This article explores the importance of these two updates for color fidelity evaluation. It shows how the color space update results in a substantial spread of the new color fidelity scores relative to the old CIE Ra values and how the sample set update results in an overall reduction of color fidelity scores for most light source spectra with high CIE Ra ({$\geq$}80) and high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) values, especially those with narrowband or spiked spectral features. It is shown that calculated color fidelity scores are affected by the degree of sample set spectral uniformity and that, in the absence of sample set spectral uniformity, light source spectra can be tuned to yield anomalously high CIE Ra values without necessarily yielding an increase in actual perceived color fidelity.},

One of the main assumptions advocated in this article is that the structure of color categories originates from the statistical structure of the perceived color environment that was observed throughout an individual's life. The perceived color environment can be modeled as color statistics of natural images in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color categorization can be modeled as the grouping of the color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). The proposed computational model enables one to predict the location, rank, and number of color categories. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV color space. In general, the model predictions are consistent with data from psycholinguistic studies. The model might be applied in different areas of imaging science such as color quantization, image quality, and gamut mapping.},

  abstract = {Museums hold a wide variety of cultural properties and they organize exhibitions for the public. In history museums, a number of interpretive materials are necessary to present a specific historical theme. However, due to limitation of space, the number of displayed materials is severely restricted. There are various types of guidance systems in museums, however, most systems have not yet responded to visitors' needs. Therefore, a useful guidance system is necessary to satisfy their needs and also to enhance their understandings of the exhibitions. In order to create such guidance system, applications of imaging technology can become a solution to overcome these restrictions and meet the requirements. In this research, a visual guidance system using a data projector was examined in the National Museum of Japanese History. In the kimono (traditional Japanese clothing) section, the projector was used to simulate color changes of the materials under different illuminants. The projector also highlighted areas where annotations were featured in the kimono. The validity of using the projector system was confirmed by results from an interview survey. To further develop this visual guidance system, an augmented reality system consisted of cooperation between the projector and a digital camera was also examined.},

Practical realization of these concepts has been demonstrated in this pilot study which combines a number of simulations with tests using real LEDs (light emitting diodes). Such sources are capable of providing highly efficient lighting systems with good energy conservation potential.

This metric works on the whole image by using an algorithm of regions extraction and another exploiting adjacent matrix. Different algorithms of regions extraction are implemented (classification and segmentation) to raise the importance of this step inside the no-reference metric and to know where this regions extraction is needed, either in the input image or in the perceveid (output) image. Finally, the metric correlates in a significant manner with the subjective results.},

  abstract = {The paper elaborates on understanding, measuring and optimizing perceived color quality of natural images. We introduce a model for optimal color reproduction of natural scenes which is based on the assumption that color quality of natural images is constrained by perceived naturalness and colorfulness of these images. To verify the model, a few experimentswere carried out where subjects estimated the perceived `naturalness', `colorfulness' and `quality' of images of natural scenes. The judgments were related to statistical parameters of the color point distribution across the images in the CIELUV color space. It was found that the perceptually optimal color reproduction can be derived from this statistic within the framework of our model. We specify naturalness, colorfulness and quality indices, describing the observer's judgments. Finally, an algorithm for optimizing perceived quality of color reproduction of natural scenes is discussed.},

A comparative analysis of within-scenes and between-scenes colourfulness assessments was performed. Images were created by varying chroma in the CIELUV colour space while lightness and hue-angle were kept constant. Experiment 1 shows the results of a multidimensional analysis of the differences-scaling in perceived colourfulness. Experiment 2 includes a unidimensional investigation of the direct-scaling of the magnitude of perceived colourfulness. Both experiments confirm that colourfulness judgments highly correlate with a linear combination of the mean of the distribution of chroma values and its standard deviation. That was also verified in Experiment 3 with ``Mondrian''-like stimuli (spatially scrambled versions of the images of natural scenes). Colourfulness judgments of natural scenes, but not ``Mondrian''-like scenes, brought out systematic differences between observers. In order to interpret and quantify these differences, a model of individual strategies in colourfulness judgments is developed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Trichromatic colour vision is of considerable importance to primates but is absent in other eutherian mammals. Primate colour vision is traditionally believed to have evolved for finding food in the forest. Recent work has tested the ecological importance of trichromacy to primates, both by measuring the spectral and chemical properties of food eaten in the wild, and by testing the relative foraging abilities of dichromatic and trichromatic primates. Molecular studies have revealed the genetic mechanisms of the evolution of trichromacy, and are providing new insight into visual pigment gene expression and colour vision defects. By drawing together work from these different fields, we can gain a better understanding of how natural selection has shaped the evolution of trichromatic colour vision in primates and also about mechanisms of gene duplication, heterozygote advantage and balancing selection.},

  issn = {0042-6989},
  abstract = {Although trichromacy in Old and New World primates is based on three visual pigments with spectral peaks in the violet (SW, shortwave), green (MW, middlewave) and yellow\textendash{}green (LW, longwave) regions of the spectrum, the underlying genetic mechanisms differ. The SW pigment is encoded in both cases by an autosomal gene and, in Old World primates, the MW and LW pigments by separate genes on the X chromosome. In contrast, there is a single polymorphic X-linked gene in most New World primates with three alleles coding for spectrally distinct pigments. The one reported exception to this rule is the New World howler monkey that follows the Old World system of separate LW and MW genes. A comparison of gene sequences in these different genetic systems indicates that the duplication that gave rise to the separate MW and LW genes of Old World primates is more ancient than that in the howler monkey. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the two howler monkey pigments show similarities to the pigments encoded by the polymorphic gene of other New World primates. It would appear therefore that the howler monkey gene duplication arose after the split between New and Old World primates and was generated by an unequal crossover that placed two different forms of the New World polymorphic gene on to a single chromosome. In contrast, the lack of identity at variable sites within the New and Old World systems argues for the origin of the separate genes in Old World primates by the duplication of a single form of the gene followed by divergence to give spectrally distinct LW and MW pigments. In contrast, the similarity in amino acid variation across the tri-allelic system of New World primates indicates that this polymorphism had a single origin in New World primates. A striking feature of all these pigments is the use of a common set of substitutions at three amino acid sites to achieve the spectral shift from MW at around 530 nm to LW at around 560 nm. The separate origin of the trichromacy in New and Old World primates would indicate that the selection of these three sites is the result of convergent evolution, perhaps as a consequence of visual adaptation in both cases to foraging for yellow and orange fruits against a green foliage.},

  abstract = {Trichromacy in all Old World primates is dependent on separate X-linked MW and LW opsin genes that are organized into a head-to-tail tandem array flanked on the upstream side by a locus control region (LCR). The 5{${'}$} regions of these two genes show homology for only the first 236 bp, although within this region, the differences are conserved in humans, chimpanzees, and two species of cercopithecoid monkeys. In contrast, most New World primates have only a single polymorphic X-linked opsin gene; all males are dichromats and trichromacy is achieved only in those females that possess a different form of this gene on each X chromosome. By sequencing the upstream region of this gene in a New World monkey, the marmoset, we have been able to demonstrate the presence of an LCR in an equivalent position to that in Old World primates. Moreover, the marmoset sequence shows extensive homology from the coding region to the LCR with the upstream sequence of the human LW gene, a distance of {$>$}3 kb, whereas homology with the human MW gene is again limited to the first 236 bp, indicating that the divergent MW sequence identifies the site of insertion of the duplicated gene. This is further supported by the presence of an incomplete Alu element on the upstream side of this insertion point in the MW gene of both humans and a cercopithecoid monkey, with additional Alu elements present further upstream. Therefore, these Aluelements may have been involved in the initial gene duplication and may also be responsible for the high frequency of gene loss and gene duplication within the opsin gene array. Full trichromacy is present in one species of New World monkey, the howler monkey, in which separate MW and LW genes are again present. In contrast to the separate genes in humans, however, the upstream sequences of the two howler genes show homology with the marmoset for at least 600 bp, which is well beyond the point of divergence of the human MW and LW genes, and each sequence is associated with a different LCR, indicating that the duplication in the howler monkey involved the entire upstream region.

Observers are asked to balance the two for visual equality. Results have shown that a significant difference in illuminance is needed to match lamps of different spectral distribution for visual equality. Lamps of higher colour quality require lower illuminance than do lamps of poorer colour quality. The majority of observers expressed a preference to work in the booth illuminated by the source of higher colour quality, despite a significantly lower illuminance.

Tuning light source SPD to better match the sensitivity of visual perception may allow the same spatial brightness but at lower illuminance with potential reductions in energy consumption. Consideration of experimental design was used to review 70 studies of spatial brightness. Of these, the 19 studies considered to provide credible evidence of SPD effects were used to explore metrics for predicting the effect of SPD but did not provide conclusive evidence of a suitable metric, in part because of incomplete reporting of SPD characteristics. For future work, these data provide an independent database for validating proposed metrics.},

These sets include large populations of spectral reflectances, some of which represent individual natural surfaces but not their relative abundances in nature. The aim of this study was to determine whether spatial cone-excitation ratios are preserved under illuminant changes within the natural visual environment. A fast hyperspectral imaging system was used to obtain populations of 640,000 reflectance spectra from each of 30 natural scenes. The statistics of spatial cone-excitation ratios for randomly selected pairs of points in these scenes were determined for two extreme daylights. Almost-invariant ratios were common, suggesting that they represent a reliable property of the natural visual environment and a suitable foundation for visual color constancy.},

Based on this extended model, two kinds of chromatic-adaptation transforms were derived, which correspond to lightness-chroma match and brightness-colorfulness match. The chromatic-adaptation transform for lightness-chroma match is also an extension of the transform proposed by CIE for further testing. The differences between the two transforms were confirmed by visual observations. The usefulness of a combination of a color-appearance model and its corresponding chromatic adaptation transform is discussed. In addition, the practical importance of brightness and colorfulness is discussed.},

Whereas chromatic adaptation requires many seconds of time and occurs for simple visual scenes, color constancy asserts itself immediately and is most powerful in complex visual scenes. Furthermore, models of chromatic adaptation are not so illuminant invariant as other models of color vision. Therefore, a new operational foundation for color constancy is proposed, and existing non-adaptation models of color constancy are enumerated for future tests.},

  abstract = {Colour constancy is traditionally interpreted as the stable appearance of the colour of a surface despite changes in the spectral composition of the illumination. When colour constancy has been assessed quantitatively, however, by observers making matches between surfaces illuminated by different sources, its completeness has been found to be poor. An alternative operational approach to colour constancy may he taken which concentrates instead on detecting the underlying chromatic relationship between the parts of a surface under changes in the illuminant. Experimentally the observer's task was to determine whether a change in the appearance of a surface was due to a change in its reflecting properties or to a change in the incident light. Observers viewed computer simulations of a row of three Mondrian patterns of Munsell chips. The centre pattern was a reference pattern illuminated by a simulated, spatially uniform daylight; one of the outer patterns was identical but illuminated by a different daylight; and the other outer pattern was equivalent but not obtainable from the centre pattern by such a change in illuminant. Different patterns and different shifts in daylight were generated in each experimental trial. The task of the observer was to identify which of the outer patterns was the result of an illuminant change. Observers made reliable discriminations of the patterns with displays of durations from several seconds to less than 200 ms, and for one observer, with displays of 1 ms. By these measures, human observers appear capable of colour constancy that is extremely rapid, and probably preattentive in origin.},

  abstract = {When the illumination on a scene changes, so do the visual signals elicited by that scene. In spite of these changes, the objects within a scene tend to remain constant in their apparent colour. We start this review by discussing the psychophysical procedures that have been used to quantify colour constancy. The transformation imposed on the visual signals by a change in illumination dictates what the visual system must `undo' to achieve constancy. The problem is mathematically underdetermined, and can be solved only by exploiting regularities of the visual world. The last decade has seen a substantial increase in our knowledge of such regularities as technical advances have made it possible to make empirical measurements of large numbers of environmental scenes and illuminants. This review provides a taxonomy of models of human colour constancy based first on the assumptions they make about how the inverse transformation might be simplified, and second, on how the parameters of the inverse transformation might be set by elements of a complex scene. Candidate algorithms for human colour constancy are represented graphically and pictorially, and the availability and utility of an accurate estimate of the illuminant is discussed. Throughout this review, we consider both the information that is, in principle, available and empirical assessments of what information the visual system actually uses. In the final section we discuss where in our visual systems these computations might be implemented.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {The phenomenon of colour constancy in human visual perception keeps surface colours constant, despite changes in their reflected light due to changing illumination. Although colour constancy has evolved under a constrained subset of illuminations, it is unknown whether its underlying mechanisms, thought to involve multiple components from retina to cortex, are optimised for particular environmental variations. Here we demonstrate a new method for investigating colour constancy using illumination matching in real scenes which, unlike previous methods using surface matching and simulated scenes, allows testing of multiple, real illuminations. We use real scenes consisting of solid familiar or unfamiliar objects against uniform or variegated backgrounds and compare discrimination performance for typical illuminations from the daylight chromaticity locus (approximately blue-yellow) and atypical spectra from an orthogonal locus (approximately red-green, at correlated colour temperature 6700 K), all produced in real time by a 10-channel LED illuminator. We find that discrimination of illumination changes is poorer along the daylight locus than the atypical locus, and is poorest particularly for bluer illumination changes, demonstrating conversely that surface colour constancy is best for blue daylight illuminations. Illumination discrimination is also enhanced, and therefore colour constancy diminished, for uniform backgrounds, irrespective of the object type. These results are not explained by statistical properties of the scene signal changes at the retinal level. We conclude that high-level mechanisms of colour constancy are biased for the blue daylight illuminations and variegated backgrounds to which the human visual system has typically been exposed.},

  issn = {0920-5691, 1573-1405},
  abstract = {Color constancy is the skill by which it is possible to tell the color of an object even under a colored light. I interpret the color of an object as its color under a fixed canonical light, rather than as a surface reflectance function. This leads to an analysis that shows two distinct sets of circumstances under which color constancy is possible. In this framework, color constancy requires estimating the illuminant under which the image was taken. The estimate is then used to choose one of a set of linear maps, which is applied to the image to yield a color descriptor at each point. This set of maps is computed in advance. The illuminant can be estimated using image measurements alone, because, given a number of weak assumptions detailed in the text, the color of the illuminant is constrained by the colors observed in the image. This constraint arises from the fact that surfaces can reflect no more light than is cast on them. For example, if one observes a patch that excites the red receptor strongly, the illuminant cannot have been deep blue. Two algorithms are possible using this constraint, corresponding to different assumptions about the world. The first algorithm, Crule will work for any surface reflectance. Crule corresponds to a form of coefficient rule, but obtains the coefficients by using constraints on illuminant color. The set of illuminants for which Crule will be successful depends strongly on the choice of photoreceptors: for narrowband photoreceptors, Crule will work in an unrestricted world. The second algorithm, Mwext, requires that both surface reflectances and illuminants be chosen from finite dimensional spaces; but under these restrictive conditions it can recover a large number of parameters in the illuminant, and is not an attractive model of human color constancy. Crule has been tested on real images of Mondriaans, and works well. I show results for Crule and for the Retinex algorithm of Land (Land 1971; Land 1983; Land 1985) operating on a number of real images. The experimental work shows that for good constancy, a color constancy system will need to adjust the gain of the receptors it employs in a fashion analagous to adaptation in humans.},

In Part I we repeated that experiment, quantifying the color sensations for each of the many Mondrian areas. In Part II we show that each area's color sensation correlates with a triplet of reflectances measured with photodetectors having the same spectral sensitivities as the cone pigments in the eye. This result provides a description of what the visual system does, but it does not provide a mechanism for how the visual system can do it because the reflectance measurements required the use of a reflectance standard and unchanging illumination. In Part III we describe a model for color sensations that computes three reflectances from the wavelength-radiance distribution without reflectance or illumination standards: hence, it is able to predict the color sensations seen by the observer. The model is able to predict gray, red. yellow, green and blue sensations associated with areas that send identical wavelength-radiance distributions to the eye.},

This leads to paradoxical adaptation predictions for the colors that have negative Von Kries coordinates. A solution is proposed here that expresses the asymmetric-matching relation of chromatic adaptation as the product of two matrix transformations, given source illuminant 1 and destination illuminant 2: from source tristimulus values via adaptation matrix 1 to the adapted state coordinates, and from the adapted state via the inverse of adaptation matrix 2 to the destination illuminant tristimulus values. To avoid the sharpening instability, the entire spectrum locus must lie within the positive octant of the adapted state tristimulus space. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The theoretical requirements for constancy have been better delineated and the range of experimental techniques has been greatly expanded; novel invariant properties of images and a variety of neural mechanisms have been identified; and increasing recognition has been given to the relevance of natural surfaces and scenes as laboratory stimuli. Even so, there remain many theoretical and experimental challenges, not least to develop an account of color constancy that goes beyond deterministic and relatively simple laboratory stimuli and instead deals with the intrinsically variable nature of surfaces and illuminations present in the natural world.},

  abstract = {The eminence of Herbert Eugene Ives has been a cascading influence over color science, and particularly over activities in the CIE, throughout this century. Ives is well known for having been the first to measure the luminosity function, nine years before Guild's measurements became the basis of the first CIE standard. He also represented in explicit equation form the algebra of transforming primaries in trstimulus space and representing the transformation in projective chromaticity coordinates. [Ives was not the first to discuss such transformations, for they had been implicit in Grassmann's laws and in Maxwell's color triangle since the middle of the nineteenth century. However, he rendered the rather abstract geometry into a form readily accessible to engineers.] In addition, Ives was a pioneer in the art and science of simulating daylight byplacing filters in front of tungsten illumination sources. Finally, about thirty years ahead of his time, Ives anticipated the Fourier approach to timedependence in vision. However, a lesser-known achievement of Ives was his contribution to the technology and assessment of color rendering by light sources. In particular, this work comprised what may be the first computational test of von Kries's theory of color constancy. This early work, which contained a startling number of the in gredients of modern work in color constancy, is reprinted as this month's Classical Article. Ives had neither good standard apparatus for measuring spectral reflectance, nor the convenience of a computer. Therefore, he invented piecewise-constant reflectance spectra that were plausible in the sense of having values between 0.1 and 1, and three or fewer transitions across the visible spectrum (see Fig. 3). to obtain reflected-light tristimulus values in the absence of CIE color-matching functions, he first multiplied Koenig's sprimary-sensation curves by two illuminant spectral power distributions (see Fig. 1) to get what Worthey called much later ``object-color matching functions.'' He then summed the values over wavelength, weighted by the block reflectances, to obtain the tristimulus values. the differences in chromaticity for the same reflectance under the two different illuminants are recorded in Fig. 4 as ``colorimetric shifts.'' Although these colorimetric shifts are mathematically definite and useful quantities to compute, Ives realized that, in themselves, they do not represent changes in color percepts under change of illumination. Rather, the visual system undergoes an adaptation to the prevailing illumination that transforms the measured chromaticities of reflected lights to other values. This transformation implements Helmholtz's ``discounting of the illuminant,'' an attempt of the visual system to restore the visual representation of object reflectances to illuminant-independent positions in the space of perceived colors. As a particular way to discount the illuminant (and hence to achieve what is known as color constancy), Ives chose to divide each tristimulus value of a reflected light by the corresponding tristimulus value of a white (with a reflectance of 1 across the spectrum). This algorithm, an application of von Kries's model of chromatic adaptation,6,7 certainly sends the illuminant unerringly to the point (1, 1, 1), independent of the spectrum of the illuminant. However, the algorithm does not perform of satisfactorily on other reflectance spectra. Although the colorimetric shifts are reduced by the von Kries adaptation, there are still residual shifts (see Fig. 5). This kind of analysis is quite revealing of the limitations of color constancy, especially constancy of the von Kries sort. an analysis of the same sort on measured reflectance spectra was not done until the work of Helson, et al. in 1952. Other analyses followed, stimulated by the retinex theory of Edwin Land and including the work of McCann, McKee, and Taylor and Worthey. of course, the question remained unanswered and hotly debated as to how the visual system infers the tristimulus values of the white object that it uses as the denominator in the von Kries adaptation; this has been discussed by Land, McCann, and Brainard and Wandell, among others. Another question is to define the spectral assumptions (for illuminants, reflectances, and color-matching functions) under which the colorimetric shifts would reduce to zero for nonwhite reflectances. Much has been written in this area, including the following kinds of assumptions: (a) reflectances, color-matching functions, and illuminant spectra that are piecewise constant over the same bands in the visible spectrum; (b) very narrowband color-matching functions, but unconstrained illuminants and reflectances;16,17 (c) reflectance spectra that are designed to avoid a ``forbidden subspace'' dictated by the (unconstrained) illuminant spectra and color-matching functions; and finally (d) reflectance and illuminant spectra that must be linear combinations of two and three basis functions (respectively), or the reverse, and the measured color-matching functions are linearly combined to achieve the von Kries invariance.19,20 Other simulations have also been done with models different from that of von Kries, starting with Helson, et al., and commencing with more modern theories.22,23,24 (See Pokorny, et al. for an excellent review of the more modern theories.) Such is the legacy of the article by Ives. The reader of Ives's article will note the claim to priority at the beginning of the second paragraph. to my best knowledge, this claim is true, and can be trusted even though Ives has not referred to any prior investigators by explicit citation (even to the article by Koenig or to the theory of von Kries). the reader will also note that the author refers to his own ongoing work in daylight simulation using filters that was to appear two years later in finished form. However, I have learned from Calvin McCamy of earlier work on daylight design that was not referenced by Ives.27,28 Perhaps Ives viewed his article as apractical note for engineers rather than as a scholarly tract. A historical question I have not yet completely resolved is whether von Kries viewed his transformation as a vehicle to Helmholtz's discounting of the illuminant, or whether von Kries viewed his transformation merely as offering degrees of freedom that would reveal the particular linear combination of color-matching functions that are receptor fundamentals. If the latter were true, then Ives may have been the first to use the von Kries transformation in a theory of color constancy. the Englishtranslated von Kries articles with which we are familiar do not discuss color constancy. History seems to have given only rare acknowledgment to Ives's ``Color of the illuminant'' article. In fact, it was only by reading the scholarly review in Helson, et al. that I became aware of the article at all. the reason for this paucity of acknowledgment can hardly be Ives's lack of eminence in his own time. Rather, it seems that his methodology in this particular article was well ahead of its time, even by the standards of his other early work that presaged the methods of the CIE. Readers who are interested in more complete accounts of the life and accomplishments of Herbert E. Ives may consult the testimonial upon his receipt of the Ives medal (named after his father, and given by the Optical Society of America), and also might find helpful the journal obituary. In particular, Ives was quite critical of Einstein's theory; he published over 30 papers about relativity starting the year he received the Ives medal, which have been reprinted with commentary. His publication list includes subjects as diverse as television, spectroscopy and Special Relativity. Much more could be written in a more generalized context about the contributions of Herbert E. Ives.},

  abstract = {Background: The perceived color at each point in a visual scene depends on the relationship between light signals from that point, and light signals from surrounding areas of the scene. In the well known phenomenon of simultaneous color contrast, changing the overall brightness or hue of an object's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived brightness or hue of the object's color. Color contrast is thought to contribute to color constancy with changes in illumination.

Results: We report a new type of simultaneous color contrast, in which changing only the variance (i.e. contrasts and saturations), but not the mean, of colors in a test spot's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived contrast and saturation of the test spot's color. Objects appear much more vivid and richly colored against low-contrast, gray surrounds than against high-contrast, multicolored surrounds.

Conclusions: Color appearance depends not just on the mean color of the surround, but also on the distribution of surround colors about the mean. This novel form of simultaneous color contrast is inconsistent with a variety of models of color appearance, including those based on sensitivity regulation at the receptor level, and those in which the effects of complex surrounds on color appearance can be reduced to adaptation to the illuminant or induction from a homogeneous `equivalent surround'. It tends to normalize the gamut of perceived colors in each visual scene and may also contribute to color constancy under viewing conditions that affect contrast.},

The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be synthesized in a similar way from examples.

The long history of color preference studies has been described as ``bewildering, confused and contradictory'' [1]. Although recent studies [1\textendash{}3] tend to agree on a universal preference for `blue', the variety and lack of control in measurement methods have made it difficult to extract a systematic, quantitative description of preference. Furthermore, despite abundant evidence for sex differences in other visual domains, and specifically in other tasks of color perception [4,5], there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of sex differences in color preference. This fact is perhaps surprising, given the prevalence and longevity of the notion that little girls differ from boys in preferring `pink' [6]. Here we report a robust, cross-cultural sex difference in color preference, revealed by a rapid paired-comparison task. Individual color preference patterns are summarized by weights on the two fundamental neural dimensions that underlie color coding in the human visual system. We find a consistent sex difference in these weights, which, we suggest, may be linked to the evolution of sex-specific behavioral uses of trichromacy.},

  abstract = {Color constancy \textemdash{} by which objects tend to appear the same color under changes in illumination \textemdash{} is most likely achieved by several mechanisms, operating at different levels in the visual system. One powerful contributory mechanism is simultaneous spatial color contrast. Under changes in natural illumination the spatial ratios of within-type cone excitations between natural surfaces tend to be preserved (Foster and Nascimento, 1994); therefore, the neural encoding of colors as spatial contrasts tends to achieve constancy. Several factors are known to influence the strength of chromatic contrast induction between surfaces, including their relative luminance, spatial scale, spatial configuration and context (Ware and Cowan, 1982; Zaidi et al., 1991). Here we test the hypothesis that color contrast is weakened by differences between surfaces which indicate that they may be under distinct illuminants. We summarize psychophysical measurements of the effects of relative motion, relative depth and texture differences on chromatic contrast induction. Of these factors, only texture differences between surfaces weaken chromatic contrast induction. We also consider neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence and conclude that the mechanisms which mediate local chromatic contrast effects are sited at low levels in the visual system, in primary visual cortex (V1) or below, prior to image segmentation mechanisms which require computation of relative depth or motion. V1 and lower areas may therefore play a larger role in color constancy than previously thought.},

Data are presented showing that, if the changes in the appearance of a scene were sufficiently great, subjects were capable of making the required discriminations highly reliably, and without scrutiny.},

  abstract = {Colour constancy is a central problem for any visual system performing a task which requires stable perception of the colour world. To solve the colour constancy problem we estimate the colour of the prevailing light and then, at the second stage, remove it.Two of the most commonly used simple techniques for estimating the colour of the light are the Grey-World and Max-RGB algorithms. In this paper we begin by observing that this two colour constancy computations will respectively return the right answer if the average scene colour is grey or the maximum is white (and conversely, the degree of failure is proportional to the extent that these assumptions hold). We go on to ask the following question: ``Would we perform better colour constancy by assuming the scene average is some shade of grey?''. We give a mathematical answer to this question. Firstly, we show that Max-RGB and Grey-World are two instantiations of Minkowski norm. Secondly, that for a large calibrated dataset L 6 norm colour constancy works best overall (we have improved the performance achieved by a simple normalization based approach). Surprisingly we found performance to be similar to more elaborated algorithm.},

We discuss these flaws in detail and suggest more appropriate statistical tests. We show that using these tests conclusions as to the relative performance of algorithms are significantly changed as compared to the original analysis of the data. In particular we conclude that the performance of two algorithms: Gamut mapping and color by correlation is statistically equivalent and significantly better than the three other algorithms tested (Max-RGB and two versions of Grey-world).},

The spatial configuration of the adapting background was varied to measure the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for chromatic adaptation. The temporal configuration of the adapting background was varied to measure the time-course of these mechanisms. The results show that chromatic adaptation is spatially localized with a time-course on the order of 10 sec.

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
In bright light, mammals use a distinct photopigment (melanopsin) to measure irradiance for centrally mediated responses such as circadian entrainment. We aimed to determine whether the information generated by melanopsin is also used by the visual system as a signal for light adaptation. To this end, we compared retinal and thalamic responses to a range of artificial and natural visual stimuli presented using spectral compositions that either approximate the mouse's experience of natural daylight (``daylight'') or are selectively depleted of wavelengths to which melanopsin is most sensitive (``mel-low'').
Results
We found reproducible and reversible changes in the flash electroretinogram between daylight and mel-low. Simultaneous recording in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) revealed that these reflect changes in feature selectivity of visual circuits in both temporal and spatial dimensions. A substantial fraction of units preferred finer spatial patterns in the daylight condition, while the population of direction-sensitive units became tuned to faster motion. The dLGN contained a richer, more reliable encoding of natural scenes in the daylight condition. These effects were absent in mice lacking melanopsin.
Conclusions
The feature selectivity of many neurons in the mouse dLGN is adjusted according to a melanopsin-dependent measure of environmental brightness. These changes originate, at least in part, within the retina. Melanopsin performs a role analogous to a photographer's light meter, providing an independent measure of irradiance that determines optimal setting for visual circuits.},

  shorttitle = {From Spectral Information to Animal Colour Vision},
  abstract = {Many animals use the spectral distribution of light to guide behaviour, but whether they have colour vision has been debated for over a century. Our strong subjective experience of colour and the fact that human vision is the paradigm for colour science inevitably raises the question of how we compare with other species. This article outlines four grades of `colour vision' that can be related to the behavioural uses of spectral information, and perhaps to the underlying mechanisms. In the first, even without an (image-forming) eye, simple organisms can compare photoreceptor signals to locate a desired light environment. At the next grade, chromatic mechanisms along with spatial vision guide innate preferences for objects such as food or mates; this is sometimes described as wavelength-specific behaviour. Here, we compare the capabilities of di- and trichromatic vision, and ask why some animals have more than three spectral types of receptors. Behaviours guided by innate preferences are then distinguished from a grade that allows learning, in part because the ability to learn an arbitrary colour is evidence for a neural representation of colour. The fourth grade concerns colour appearance rather than colour difference: for instance, the distinction between hue and saturation, and colour categorization. These higher-level phenomena are essential to human colour perception but poorly known in animals, and we suggest how they can be studied. Finally, we observe that awareness of colour and colour qualia cannot be easily tested in animals.},

  abstract = {Existing research in color naming and categorization primarily reflects two opposing views: A \emph{Cultural Relativist} view that posits color perception is greatly shaped by culturally specific language associations and perceptual learning, and a \emph{Universalist} view that emphasizes panhuman shared color processing as the basis for color naming similarities within and across cultures. Recent empirical evidence finds color processing differs both within and across cultures. This divergent color processing raises new questions about the sources of previously observed cultural coherence and cross-cultural universality. The present article evaluates the relevance of individual variation on the mainstream model of color naming. It also presents an alternate view that specifies how color naming and categorization is shaped by both panhuman cognitive universals and socio-cultural evolutionary processes. This alternative view, expressed, in part, using an \emph{Interpoint Distance Model} of color categorization, is compatible with new empirical results showing divergent color processing within and across cultures. It suggests that universalities in color naming and categorization may naturally arise across cultures because color language and color categories primarily reflect culturally modal linguistic mappings, and categories are shaped by universal cognitive constructs and culturally salient features of color. Thus, a shared cultural representation of color based on widely shared cognitive dimensions may be the proper foundation for universalities of color naming and categorization. Across cultures this form of representation may result from convergent responses to similar pressures on color lexicon evolution.},

  abstract = {Dichromatic subjects can name colors accurately, even though they cannot discriminate among red-green hues (Jameson \& Hurvich, 1978). This result is attributed to a normative language system that dichromatic observers developed by learning subtle visual cues to compensate for their impoverished color system. The present study used multidimensional scaling techniques to compare color categorization spaces of color-vision deficient (CVD) subjects to those of normal trichromat (NT) subjects, and consensus analysis estimated the normative effect of language on categorization. Subjects sorted 140 Munsell color samples in three different ways: a free sorting task (unlimited number of categories), a constrained sorting task (number of categories limited to eight), and a constrained naming task (limited to eight basic color terms). CVD color categories were comparable to those of NT subjects. For both CVD and NT subjects, a common color categorization space derived from the three tasks was well described by a three-dimensional model, with the first two dimensions corresponding to reddish-greenish and yellowish-bluish axes. However, the third axis, which was associated with an achromatic dimension in NTs, was not identified in the CVD model. Individual differences multidimensional scaling failed to reveal group differences in the sorting tasks. In contrast, the personal color naming spaces of CVD subjects exhibited a relative compression of the yellowish-bluish dimension that is inconsistent with the typical deutan-type color spaces derived from more direct measures of perceptual color judgments. As expected, the highest consensus among CVDs (77\%) and NTs (82\%) occurred in the naming task. The categorization behaviors studied in this experiment seemed to rely more on learning factors, and may reveal little about CVD perceptual representation of colors.},

  abstract = {The technological fields where solid-state lighting can be applied are constantly growing. In relation to this topic, we built a spectral LED-based tuneable light source for the reconstruction of CIE standard illuminants. This light source consists of 31 spectral channels from 400nm to 700nm, an integrating cube and a control board with 16 bit resolution. Moreover, a minimization routine was developed to calculate the weighting values per channel for reproducing standard illuminants. The differences in colorimetric and fitting parameters between standard spectra and the theoretical and experimental ones, showed that the reconstructed spectra were very similar to the standard ones, specially for the D65 and A illuminants. However, there was a certain mismatching from 500nm to 600nm due to the lack of LEDs in this region. In conclusion, the developed LED-based light source and minimization routine are able to reproduce CIE standard illuminants with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {An LED solar simulator containing LEDs emitting at 23 different wavelengths is described. Taking into account the natural spectral width of each of the LED wavelengths, a reasonably well-behaved and spike-free spectral continuum is demonstrated. The LED light source is based on a modular design that facilitates fabrication of arbitrarily large area simulators for both single solar cell and multi-cell module test and evaluation. The spectral tunability of this simulator makes it an attractive instrument for use in evaluating the performance of both conventional solar cells and tandem solar cells. The basic modular building block is a 10 cm x 10 cm ``tile'' consisting of the LED emitter platform with reflecting side mirrors and driver electronics conveniently located directly underneath the emitter platform in a compact yet flexible configuration. Combinations of tiles facilitate manufacture of solar simulators of arbitrarily large size and shape, with the advantages of high reliability, spectral tunability, lighter weight, no water cooling requirements and absence of high voltages. Excellent spectral mixing and intensity uniformity is obtained on the measurement plane, resulting in a simulator that meets Class AAA specifications according to ASTM and IEC standards.},

We now report on using the color rendition engine for revealing individual and cultural differences in color quality preferences of 205 American and Chinese subjects. Our study demonstrated that the majority of individuals preferred the color blend with the same statistical figures of merit on the average but with a much larger spread of blends for Americans. For both groups, the color rendition preferences depended on the object being illuminated. This was demonstrated by illuminating a set of common colored objects and three different paintings. We conclude that the color quality of lighting can be optimized and enhanced using the feedback to change the spectral power distribution of the illuminating source depending on the object being illuminated and on the preferences of an individual observer and a cultural group.},

  volume = {8135},
  abstract = {In light of its capacity for remote physiological assessment over a wide range of anatomical locations, imaging photoplethysmography has become an attractive research area in biomedical and clinical community. Amongst recent iPPG studies, two separate research directions have been revealed, i.e., scientific camera based imaging PPG (iPPG) and webcam based imaging PPG (wPPG). Little is known about the difference between these two techniques. To address this issue, a dual-channel imaging PPG system (iPPG and wPPG) using ambient light as the illumination source has been introduced in this study. The performance of the two imaging PPG techniques was evaluated through the measurement of cardiac pulse acquired from the face of 10 male subjects before and after 10 min of cycling exercise. A time-frequency representation method was used to visualize the time-dependent behaviour of the heart rate. In comparison to the gold standard contact PPG, both imaging PPG techniques exhibit comparable functional characteristics in the context of cardiac pulse assessment. Moreover, the synchronized ambient light intensity recordings in the present study can provide additional information for appraising the performance of the imaging PPG systems. This feasibility study thereby leads to a new route for non-contact monitoring of vital signs, with clear applications in triage and homecare.},

At the same time, heart rate was measured by a pulse oximeter and respiratory rate was measured by a thermistor placed at the external naris. Using AR spectral analysis, two clear peaks could be detected at approximately 0.3 and 1.2 Hz. The peaks were thought to correspond to the respiratory rate and the heart rate.

The waveform of the photoplethysmographic image (PPGi) signals may be significantly affected by the light spectra and intensity. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of PPGi waveform acquisition in the red, green, and blue channels using a commercial camera in different light conditions. The system, developed for this paper, comprises of a commercial camera and light sources with varied spectra and intensities. Signals were acquired from the fingertips of 12 healthy subjects. Extensive experiments, using different wavelength lights and white light with variation light intensities, respectively, reported in this paper, showed that almost all light spectra can acquire acceptable pulse rates, but only 470-, 490-, 505-, 590-, 600-, 610-, 625-, and 660-nm wavelength lights showed better performance in PPGi waveform compared with gold standard. With lower light intensity, the light spectra {$>$}600 nm still showed better performance. The change in pulse amplitude (ac) and dc amplitude was also investigated with the different light intensity and light spectra. With increasing light intensity, the dc amplitude increased, whereas ac component showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. Most of the subjects achieved their maximum averaging ac output when averaging dc output was in the range from 180 to 220 pixel values (8 b, 255 maximum pixel value). The results suggested that an adaptive solution could be developed to optimize the design of PPGi-based physiological signal acquisition devices in different light conditions.},

  volume = {9316},
  abstract = {Non-contact camera-based imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) is useful for measuring heart rate in conditions
where contact devices are problematic due to issues such as mobility, comfort, and sanitation. Existing iPPG
methods analyse the light-tissue interaction of either active or passive (ambient) illumination. Many active
iPPG methods assume the incident ambient light is negligible to the active illumination, resulting in high power
requirements, while many passive iPPG methods assume near-constant ambient conditions. These assumptions
can only be achieved in environments with controlled illumination and thus constrain the use of such devices. To
increase the number of possible applications of iPPG devices, we propose a dual-mode active iPPG system that is
robust to changes in ambient illumination variations. Our system uses a temporally-coded illumination sequence
that is synchronized with the camera to measure both active and ambient illumination interaction for determining
heart rate. By subtracting the ambient contribution, the remaining illumination data can be attributed to the
controlled illuminant. Our device comprises a camera and an LED illuminant controlled by a microcontroller.
The microcontroller drives the temporal code via synchronizing the frame captures and illumination time at the
hardware level. By simulating changes in ambient light conditions, experimental results show our device is able
to assess heart rate accurately in challenging lighting conditions. By varying the temporal code, we demonstrate
the trade-off between camera frame rate and ambient light compensation for optimal blood pulse detection.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method to recover the pulse signal with the theory of lock-in amplifier and calculates the oxygen saturation. The pulse signal is obtained based on the method of Photoplethysmography (PPG). We use a LED as the light source and a photoelectric diode as the receiver to get a measured pulse wave. Because the pulse wave obtained by this method is easily disturbed by motion artifact, we use an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to aid PPG measurement. Firstly, the ECG signal is processed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and get the heart rate. Secondly, with the value of heart rate, a typical noise free pulse waveform can be constructed. Finally, we use it as a reference input to get a recovered pulse wave by the theory of lock-in amplifier. Thus, the value of oxygen saturation can be calculated accurately through two recovered pulse waveforms of red (660nm) and infrared (940nm) light. Some volunteers were tested. The correlation coefficient between the experimental data and the data provided by a reference instrument is 0.98, proving that this method has high reliability and utility in motion.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of the reflectance photoplethysmogram using a video camera typically positioned 1~m away from the patient's face is a promising method for monitoring the vital signs of patients without attaching any electrodes or sensors to them. Most of the papers in the literature on non-contact vital sign monitoring report results on human volunteers in controlled environments. We have been able to obtain estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate and preliminary results on changes in oxygen saturation from double-monitored patients undergoing haemodialysis in the Oxford Kidney Unit. To achieve this, we have devised a novel method of cancelling out aliased frequency components caused by artificial light flicker, using auto-regressive (AR) modelling and pole cancellation. Secondly, we have been able to construct accurate maps of the spatial distribution of heart rate and respiratory rate information from the coefficients of the AR model. In stable sections with minimal patient motion, the mean absolute error between the camera-derived estimate of heart rate and the reference value from a pulse oximeter is similar to the mean absolute error between two pulse oximeter measurements at different sites (finger and earlobe). The activities of daily living affect the respiratory rate, but the camera-derived estimates of this parameter are at least as accurate as those derived from a thoracic expansion sensor (chest belt). During a period of obstructive sleep apnoea, we tracked changes in oxygen saturation using the ratio of normalized reflectance changes in two colour channels (red and blue), but this required calibration against the reference data from a pulse oximeter.},

PPG from ear, finger and forehead probe sites, standard ECG, and Finapres blood pressure waveforms were continuously recorded from 8 healthy volunteers during baseline, blood withdrawal of 900 ml followed by the blood reinfusion. The instantaneous amplitude modulations present in heart rate (AMHR) and breathing rate (AMBR) band frequencies of PPG were extracted from high-resolution time-frequency spectrum. HR and pulse pressure showed no significant changes during the protocol. The AMHR significantly (P{$<$};0.05) decreased at 100 ml through 900 ml blood loss from ear and finger probe sites. The mean percent decrease in AMHR at 900 ml blood loss compared to baseline value was 45.2\%, 42.0\%, and 42.3\% for ear, finger and forehead PPG signals, respectively. In addition, significant increases in AMBR were found due to blood loss in ear and finger PPG signals. Even without baseline AMHR values, 900 ml blood loss detection was shown possible with specificity and sensitivity both 87.5\% from ear PPG signals. The present technique has great potential to serve as a valuable tool in the intraoperative and trauma settings to detect hemorrhage.},

  volume = {10},
  issn = {1547-5271},
  abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and associated with adverse health outcomes. Timely detection of AF can be challenging using traditional diagnostic tools. Smartphone use is increasing and may provide an inexpensive and user-friendly means to diagnoseAF.
Objective
To test the hypothesis that a smartphone-based application could detect an irregular pulse fromAF.
Methods
Seventy-six adults with persistent AF were consented for participation in our study. We obtained pulsatile time series recordings before and after cardioversion using an iPhone 4S camera. A novel smartphone application conducted real-time pulse analysis using 2 statistical methods: root mean square of successive RR difference (RMSSD/mean) and Shannon entropy (ShE). We examined the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of both algorithms using the 12-lead electrocardiogram as the gold standard.
Results
RMSDD/mean and ShE were higher in participants in AF than in those with sinus rhythm. The 2 methods were inversely related to AF in regression models adjusting for key factors including heart rate and blood pressure (beta coefficients per SD increment in RMSDD/mean and ShE were-0.20 and-0.35; P\&lt;.001). An algorithm combining the 2 statistical methods demonstrated excellent sensitivity (0.962), specificity (0.975), and accuracy (0.968) for beat-to-beat discrimination of an irregular pulse during AF from sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
In a prospectively recruited cohort of 76 participants undergoing cardioversion for AF, we found that a novel algorithm analyzing signals recorded using an iPhone 4S accurately distinguished pulse recordings during AF from sinus rhythm. Data are needed to explore the performance and acceptability of smartphone-based applications for AF detection.},

According to comScore survey, 26.2\% of U.S. adults use smart phones in their daily lives. Motivated by this statistic and the diverse capability of smart phones, we focus on utilizing them for biomedical applications. We present a new application of the smart phone with its built-in camera and microphone replacing the traditional stethoscope and cuff-based measurement technique, to quantify vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. We propose two differential blood pressure estimating techniques using the heartbeat and pulse data. The first method uses two smart phones whereas the second method replaces one of the phones with a customized external microphone. We estimate the systolic and diastolic pressure in the two techniques by computing the pulse pressure and the stroke volume from the data recorded. By comparing the estimated blood pressure values with those measured using a commercial blood pressure meter, we obtained encouraging results of 95-100\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {As a smartphone is becoming very popular and its performance is being improved fast, a smartphone shows its potential as a low-cost physiological measurement solution which is accurate and can be used beyond the clinical environment. Because cardiac pulse leads the subtle color change of a skin, a pulsatile signal which can be described as photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal can be measured through recording facial video using a digital camera. In this paper, we explore the potential that the reliable heart rate can be measured remotely by the facial video recorded using smartphone camera. First, using the front facing-camera of a smartphone, facial video was recorded. We detected facial region on the image of each frame using face detection, and yielded the raw trace signal from the green channel of the image. To extract more accurate cardiac pulse signal, we applied independent component analysis (ICA) to the raw trace signal. The heart rate was extracted using frequency analysis of the raw trace signal and the analyzed signal from ICA. The accuracy of the estimated heart rate was evaluated by comparing with the heart rate from reference electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Finally, we developed FaceBEAT, an iPhone application for remote heart rate measurement, based on this study.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects three to five million Americans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing methods to diagnose this paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an accuracy of 100\% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.},

We therefore developed a new smartphone program, named iPhysioMeter, that makes it possible to measure beat-by-beat HR and ln NPV using only a smartphone. We examined its accuracy against conventional laboratory measures. Mental stress tasks were used to alter HR and ln NPV in 12 participants. Bland\textendash{}Altman analyses revealed negligible proportional bias for HR and ln NPV or for their change values, expressed as {$\Delta$}HR and {$\Delta$}ln NPV. However, a relatively large fixed bias did emerge for ln NPV, as well as a small one for {$\Delta$}ln NPV, although both were within the limits of agreement. These findings suggest that iPhysioMeter can yield valid measures of the absolute level of HR and of relative changes in ln NPV.},

Monitoring was performed in the supine and tilt positions for independent iPhone 4s (2 min recordings, n=9) and Droid (5 min recordings, n=13) experiments, and the following heart rate and heart rate variability parameters were estimated: heart rate, low frequency power, high frequency power, ratio of low to high frequency power, standard deviation of the RR intervals, and root mean square of successive RR-differences. Results demonstrate that accurate heart rate variability parameters can be obtained from smart phone based measurements.},

This increase has been due to several factors such as development in sensor technology as well as directed efforts on political and stakeholder levels to promote projects which address the need for providing new methods for care given increasing challenges with an aging population. An important aspect of study in such system is how the data is treated and processed. This paper provides a recent review of the latest methods and algorithms used to analyze data from wearable sensors used for physiological monitoring of vital signs in healthcare services. In particular, the paper outlines the more common data mining tasks that have been applied such as anomaly detection, prediction and decision making when considering in particular continuous time series measurements. Moreover, the paper further details the suitability of particular data mining and machine learning methods used to process the physiological data and provides an overview of the properties of the data sets used in experimental validation. Finally, based on this literature review, a number of key challenges have been outlined for data mining methods in health monitoring systems.},

The objective was to provide a broad spectrum of measurement applications so that the different techniques and approaches could be presented. Digital Image and Signal Processing for Measurement Systems concentrates on signal processing for measurement systems and its objective is to provide a general overview of the area and an appropriate introduction to the topics considered. This is achieved through 10 chapters devoted to current topics of research addressed by different research groups within this area. These 10 chapters reflect advances corresponding to signals of different dimensionality. They go from mostly one dimensional signals in what would be the most traditional area of signal processing realm to RGB signals and to signals of very high dimensionality such as hyperspectral signals that can go up to dimensionalities of more than one thousand. The chapters have been thought out to provide an easy to follow introduction to the topics that are addressed, including the most relevant references, so that anyone interested in this field can get started in the area. They provide an overview of some of the problems in the area of signal and image processing for measurement systems and the approaches and techniques that relevant research groups within this area are employing to try to solve them which, in many instances are the state of the art of some of these topics.},

The system requires the user to place the tip of his/her index finger on the lens of a smart phone camera, while the flash is on. The captured video signal often contains noise generated due to (i) improper finger placement, (ii) imparting excessive pressure, which subsequently blocks normal blood circulation and (iii) movement of the fingertip. To mitigate the above issues, a two stage approach has been proposed. Firstly, the onset of good video signal is detected by formulating a finite state machine, which employs multiple window short time fast fourier transform. Only upon receiving sufficient acceptable video signal, the heart rate is computed. Results indicate that the proposed method has successfully identified and rejected noisy video signal, resulting in avoidance of erroneous output.},

  abstract = {Museums must choose illumination that will optimize observers' aesthetic experiences without compromising preservation of the artworks. Typical lighting is 3000 K at 200 lux. We examined the effects of color temperature by comparing the same ``artwork'' under several different illuminants (in side-by-side miniature museum rooms); for each painting, observers rated the preference for seeing it under one of the two illuminants; this was repeated for all pairings of illuminants. Our observers preferred higher color temperatures at about 3600 K. Between viewing trials observers' visual systems were adapted to a specific illuminant. This had no effect on preferred illumination of an artwork. To explore a wider range of artworks, we developed a set of numerical scales that could be applied directly to individual pictures; these were viewed, one at a time, in a single simulated room illuminated by one of a series of illuminants.

  abstract = {A strategy is reported to optimize lighting to reduce photochemical degradation of works of art and archival documents. The strategy revolves around improving luminous efficiency of the spectral profile to exclude light which doesn't contribute to brightness or color perception, while also trying to maintain color rendering. The work focuses on Old Master Drawings and designing filters for illuminants, but is applicable to the broad range of art and archival documents and the direct design of lighting without filters such as LED. A filter profile is identified which seems to be beneficial, or at worst neutral for all pigments measured. Underlying principles are identified: (1) The best luminous efficiencies arise from multiple band illuminants, and also improves as color rendering is sacrificed. (2) Protection of an object even late in its damage life can significantly extend its remaining life. (3) Protection of an object early in its life can possibly abate some of the light induced damage it may experience across its life, so early intervention in light protection may be advised. This report further goes on to suggest approaches to further enhance the protection, including tailoring the spectral dependence of appearance change. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The CIE General Colour Rendering Index is currently the criterion used to describe and measure the colour-rendering properties of light sources. But over the past years, there has been increasing evidence of its limitations particularly its ability to predict the perceived colour quality of light sources and especially some LEDs. In this paper, several aspects of perceived colour quality are investigated using a side-by-side paired comparison method, and the following criteria: naturalness of fruits and vegetables, colourfulness of the Macbeth Color Checker chart, visual appreciation (attractiveness/ preference) and colour difference estimations for both visual scenes. Forty-five observers with normal colour vision evaluated nine light sources at 3000 K, and 36 observers evaluated eight light sources at 4000 K. Our results indicate that perceived colour differences are better dealt by the CIECAM02 Uniform Colour Space. Naturalness is better described by fidelity indices even if they did not give perfect predictions for all differences between LED light sources. Colourfulness is well described by gamut-based indices and attractiveness was found to correlate best with gamut-based indices but also with a preference index or a memory index calculated without blue and purple hues. A very low correlation was found between appreciation and naturalness indicating that colour quality needs more than one metric to describe subjective aspects.},

  abstract = {This study looks at the perceived quality of light-emitting diode (LED)-based lighting of various colors. The objective was to find out whether LEDs could provide better (i.e., more relevant and acceptable) lighting than that which is obtained with standard halogen or fluorescent sources. The perception of objects was assessed under different lighting schemes. Subjects were invited to add red, cyan and/or amber to white LED-based light to match the halogen and fluorescence rendering on specific targets: a color chart and a painting. They were also asked to rate the difference between the two, and to express their preference. The results obtained for the perception of LED-based lighting were quite positive. Color blendings of LED light were found to provide illuminated situations similar to halogens or fluorescent sources. These blendings were well accepted, and indeed often preferred, although the color rendering index (CRI) was always low. This indicates that the CRI as it stands is inadequate to characterize the color rendering of solid-state light sources, and needs to be updated. LED-based lighting systems seem to have considerable potential for use in shops and display units, where they may well outperform existing lighting systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {This study proposes a ``visibility'' concept of colored objects that includes a combination of color brightness and appearance perception of colored objects that are illuminated by seven LED lights (each with a CIE color rendering index under 80 but with various correlated color temperatures). To determine the brightness perception of colored objects, luminance calculations and measurements were conducted. The areas of the ``color brightness graph'' in this study correspond to the results of eight different color sample papers under each of the LED lights with different CCTs. The luminance values were calculated by multiplying the SPD by the spectral luminous efficiency and spectral reflectance of a colored object. The luminance values were measured under these conditions to identify the relationship between the luminance calculations and the measured values. Efficient CCTs were identified for each color sample in terms of the brightness of the colored object. Further subjective evaluations were also conducted to identify the relationship between luminance values and subjective brightness perception. In addition, subjective evaluations of the color appearance perception were conducted to identify the overall visibility concept of colored objects. The subjective evaluations included brightness perception, color appearance, and similarity of the reference light source. The visibility of the colored objects was analyzed according to the results of the brightness and appearance perception of the colored objects that were illuminated by LED lights with various CCTs. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

With the rapid development of the light emitting diode the need for a more comprehensive approach to illumination measurement and design is particularly important.

The project explores by experiment in a full-scale mock-up gallery the lighting requirements in terms of three variables: painting illuminance, light source and light distribution within the gallery space. Subjective assessments were made using semantic differential scales and the results were analysed using factor analysis techniques. The findings indicate that a painting illuminance approaching 200 lux was required to give visual satisfaction from an illuminant with a high Colour Rendering Index and a high gamut area: also a degree of non-uniformity in light distribution was preferred. The work recommends that where strict conservation requirements are to be employed, then artificial lighting only should be used but that the galleries should be combined with other spaces lit with natural light, perhaps for the display of non-light-sensitive exhibits.},

The main aim of the TC is to recommend a colour-difference formula for complex image together with suitable perceptibility thresholds for industrial applications. With this in mind, a set of experimental results for assessing perceptibility thresholds were accumulated using printed images. The results from different data sets were found to be quite consistent. This set of images are currently being circulated and assessed at different imaging companies.},

The experiment was divided into two parts: threshold differences and supra-threshold differences for pictorial images. Part 1 of results were used to test various colour-difference formulae and to develop a simple formula based on CIELAB but adaptive to each image. The formula was further verified using Part 2 data. The results showed that the formula works well for not only threshold but also supra-threshold colour differences.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new set of color difference data using complex images was collected including small and large color differences. Using 13 images, 182 test images were generated to have various average lightness, chroma or hue values compared to the original images. Twenty observers estimated the overall color difference between the reference and manipulated images shown on an sRGB monitor with 250 cd/m2 as a peak white in a dark room. The magnitude estimation technique was adopted for the visual assessment. The parametric factors of CMC(l:c), and CIEDE2000(l:c) were optimized using the color difference data set. Results showed that CIEDE2000 performs better than CMC. The best ratio for CMC(l:c) is (4:3), while (3.5:1) is the best for CIEDE2000(l:c) for overall color difference prediction.},

  abstract = {The CIE general colour rendering index (Ra) is still the only widely used and accepted colour fidelity index for characterising white light sources. However, user preference for light sources is not determined by fidelity alone but also by colour saturation. Here, we investigate the impact of fidelity and gamut area on the preference for white light sources in three application areas: fresh food, packaged food and skin tones. Thirty-four participants evaluated the attractiveness of object appearance for seven light sources with Ra values ranging between 70 and 100 and relative gamut area index (Ga) ranging between 90 and 120. Results show that object appearance was rated as more attractive for light sources with a larger colour gamut, which have Ra values of 80 and lower. In general, light sources with relatively high spectral power in the long wavelength range, enhancing red objects, received the highest preference. We conclude that, next to fidelity, colour saturation makes a significant contribution to the appreciation of a light source. We therefore propose using Ra in conjunction with Ga and a colour rendering graphic for providing a more detailed description of the colour quality of white LED light sources.},

The spectral characteristics of the light source used during the image acquisition extremely influence the quality of the final digital reproduction of color films; this paper thoroughly discusses the criteria to be adopted to properly choose the light source. A method is described to infer the analytical densities of a color film from a set of measurements of the integral density; this provides the necessary spectroscopic information for the choice of the light source. The experimental part reports the analysis of two photographic samples from archival material: a Technicolor and an Agfacolor from the 1940s. The experiments highlighted the peculiar spectroscopic characteristics of the analyzed samples. The attention was drawn on the historical aesthetics of color film and the ethical issues related to its preservation.},

  abstract = {Our visual system can easily estimate the constant~color and material of external objects despite dynamic changes in the retinal image across viewpoints and illuminations in natural scenes. It is commonly believed that this high-level visual function, called "perceptual constancy," is acquired through postnatal learning [1], building upon low-level functions that have developed earlier, such as~image discrimination. However, we demonstrate here that before developing perceptual constancy, 3- to 4-month-old infants have a striking ability to discriminate slight image changes due to illumination that are not salient for adults. These young infants lose this ability after 5~months of age and then develop an ability to perceive distal surface properties (glossy or matte) at 7-8~months of age. Moreover, we identify the transition period between these two~functions at 5-6~months of age, wherein infants show difficulty in both image and surface discrimination. These findings support the notion that acquiring perceptual constancy leads to a loss of sensitivity to variant information, which is negligible for constant surface material perception. We suggest that the immature visual system may initially directly access local image features and then develops a complementary constant neural representation of the properties of an object.},

Retouchings which match in the daylight of the restorer's studio may become visible when the painting is viewed in different lighting conditions or is photographed. In practice the matching of blue pigments has proved to be particularly difficult. Metamerism can be avoided by selecting modern substitutes with similar spectral reflectance curves to the traditional pigments. It is shown that manganese blue is the most suitable modern pigment for matching azurite and French ultramarine for matching genuine ultramarine, and that it is inadvisable to try matching Prussian blue with French ultramarine, cobalt blue or cerulean blue. Pigments are also recommended for matching smalt and indigo provided these pigments have not undergone a degenerative colour change.},

  shorttitle = {Museum {{Skepticism}}},
  abstract = {In Museum Skepticism, art historian David Carrier traces the birth, evolution, and decline of the public art museum as an institution meant to spark democratic debate and discussion. Carrier contends that since the inception of the public art museum during the French Revolution, its development has depended on growth: on the expansion of collections, particularly to include works representing non-European cultures, and on the proliferation of art museums around the globe. Arguing that this expansionist project has peaked, he asserts that art museums must now find new ways of making high art relevant to contemporary lives. Ideas and inspiration may be found, he suggests, in mass entertainment such as popular music and movies.Carrier illuminates the public role of art museums by describing the ways they influence how art is seen: through their architecture, their collections, the narratives they offer museum visitors. He insists that an understanding of the art museum must take into account the roles of collectors, curators, and museum architects. Toward that end, he offers a series of case studies, showing how particular museums and their collections evolved. Among those who figure prominently are Baron Dominique Vivant Denon, the first director of the Louvre; Bernard Berenson, whose connoisseurship helped Isabella Stewart Gardner found her museum in Boston; Ernest Fenollosa, who assembled much of the Asian art collection now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Albert Barnes, the distinguished collector of modernist painting; and Richard Meier, architect of the J. Paul Getty Center in Los Angeles. Carrier's learned consideration of what the art museum is and has been provides the basis for understanding the radical transformation of its public role now under way.},

  volume = {39},
  issn = {0197-1360},
  abstract = {Many types of museum exhibits are susceptible to damage caused by exposure to light, and current recommendations for museum lighting include avoidance of nonvisible radiant power (UV and IR), limitation of illumination level, and restriction of exposure duration. However, these recommendations do not distinguish between the potential of incident radiant power in the visible spectrum to stimulate the sense of brightness (illuminance) and its potential to cause damage (irradiance).This article investigates the notion that the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent sources could be matched with significantly less irradiance by illumination composed of three spectral bands corresponding to red, green, and blue light. Pairs of identical artworks were displayed in two adjacent simulated art galleries, and 16 subjects adjusted the illumination in the test gallery to match the appearance of the similar display in the comparison gallery. The light source in the comparison gallery was an MR tungsten halogen display spotlight of either low (2850 K) or intermediate (4200 K) color temperature. The light source in the test gallery was either an identical MR spotlight, or it was an experimental three-band source of far lesser irradiance for which the color temperature had been matched to that in the comparison gallery.It was found that, when instructed to adjust for equality of appearance, the subjects set for equality of illuminance. For this condition, the irradiance of the artworks was significantly less for the three-band source than for either of the MR lamps. Also, at equal illuminance and color temperatures, subjects' responses indicated that they were conscious of differences in appearance between the three-band source and the MR lamps, but the difference seemed slight and they did not necessarily discriminate against the three-band source. It is concluded that a practical light source for museums could be developed that would have the potential to equal the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent lamps at a given illuminance, while exposing exhibits to significantly less irradiance, thus reducing their rate of degradation while on display.},

  abstract = {Thresholds of luminance and red-green chromatic flashes (200 msec) were measured on a yellow adapting field in the fovea and periphery (up to 12\textdegree{} eccentricity for 1\textdegree{} flashes and 21\textdegree{} eccentricity for 2\textdegree{} flashes). Chromatic sensitivity (in cone contrast coordinates) is about 7 times higher than luminance sensitivity in the fovea but falls faster with eccentricity, so that luminance and chromatic sensitivities are similar at eccentricities of 20\textdegree{} or less. At eccentricities greater than about 14\textdegree, there is a clear asymmetry wherein green chromatic flashes are considerably less detectable than red ones. By measuring complete detection contours for many ratios of incremental and decremental red and green flashes, we isolated the red and green chromatic detection mechanisms, and demonstrated that the red-green asymmetry is not a property of the L- or M-cone response per se, but rather is a property of the post-receptoral, chromatic mechanisms. The peripheral luminance and chromatic mechanisms could be further separated with a suprathreshold luminance flash (a pedestal), since an intense pedestal masks coincident luminance test flashes but facilitates the chromatic flashes. The luminance pedestal approximately linearizes the chromatic detection function (the psychometric function).},

A two-channel four-primary colorimeter allowed independent control of the rods and each of the L-, M- and S-cone photoreceptor types. At all light levels, rod contributions to inferred PC, KC and MC pathway mediated vision were linearly related to the rod incremental contrast.

Observers can, however, make fast and reliable discriminations between changes in illuminant and changes in the reflecting properties of scenes, a discriminative ability that might be based on a visual coding of spatial colour relations. This coding could be provided by the ratios of cone-photoreceptor excitations produced by light from different surfaces: for a large class of pigmented surfaces and for surfaces with random spectral reflectances, these ratios are statistically almost invariant under changes in illumination by light from the sun and sky or from a planckian radiator. Cone-excitation ratios offer a possible, although not necessarily unique, basis for perceptual colour constancy in so far as it concerns colour relations.},

  abstract = {Summary
Human visual perception is both stable and adaptive. Perception of complex objects, such as faces, is shaped by the long-term average of experience as well as immediate, comparative context. Measurements of brain activity have demonstrated corresponding neural mechanisms, including norm-based responses reflective of stored prototype representations, and adaptation induced by the immediately preceding stimulus. Here, we consider the possibility that these apparently separate phenomena can arise from a single mechanism of sensory integration operating over varying timescales. We used fMRI to measure neural responses from the fusiform gyrus while subjects observed a rapid stream of face stimuli. Neural activity at this cortical site was best explained by the integration of sensory experience over multiple sequential stimuli, following a decaying-exponential weighting function. Although this neural activity could be mistaken for immediate neural adaptation or long-term, norm-based responses, it in fact reflected a timescale of integration intermediate to both. We then examined the timescale of sensory integration across the cortex. We found a gradient that ranged from rapid sensory integration~in early visual areas, to long-term, stable representations in higher-level, ventral-temporal cortex. These findings were replicated with a new set of face stimuli and subjects. Our results suggest that a cascade of visual areas integrate sensory experience, transforming highly adaptable responses at~early stages to stable representations at higher levels.},

We review convergent findings from physiology and psychophysics with respect to asymmetries in the retinal wiring of S-ON and S-OFF visual pathways, and the associated treatment of increments and decrements in the S-cone system. Beyond the retina, we consider the lack of S-cone projections to superior colliculus and the use of S-cone stimuli in experimental psychology, for example to address questions about the mechanisms of visually driven attention. Careful selection of stimulus parameters enables psychophysicists to produce entirely reversible, temporary, ``lesions,'' and to assess behavior in the absence of specific neural subsystems.},

Abstract
Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} A recent study has shown that retinal ganglion cells containing the photopigment melanopsin, which are intrinsically photosensitive in primates, project to the pupillary control centre in the pretectum. The aim of this study was to investigate how melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) contribute to the pupillary pathway.Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We designed and built a novel multi-primary stimulation system to control stimulation of the three cone types and mRGCs independently in the human eye. We measured the latency and amplitude of transient pupillary responses to three types of test stimuli modulating excitations of mRGCs and cones (mRGC, luminance and the light flux stimuli).Results:\hspace{0.6em} It was found that the transient pupillary response to mRGC stimuli has a longer latency than that to luminance and the light flux stimuli when an onset of sinusoidal stimulus was used.Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The results indicate that we successfully demonstrated the pupillary response to mRGCs under conditions where mRGCs are isolated in humans. Furthermore, the data confirm that the delayed response disappeared when the stimulus is presented as a square-wave pulse and not weighted by a sinusoid. The similarity of time courses for the earlier phase of pupillary responses to all stimuli suggested that these transient pupillary responses were driven by a single mechanism, which is perhaps associated with cone-mediated signals.},

  abstract = {In the human, cone photoreceptors (L, M, and S) and the melanopsin-containing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are active at daytime light intensities. Signals from cones are combined both additively and in opposition to create the perception of overall light and color. Similar mechanisms seem to be at work in the control of the pupil's response to light. Uncharacterized however, is the relative contribution of melanopsin and S cones, with their overlapping, short-wavelength spectral sensitivities. We measured the response of the human pupil to the separate stimulation of the cones and melanopsin at a range of temporal frequencies under photopic conditions. The S-cone and melanopsin photoreceptor channels were found to be low-pass, in contrast to a band-pass response of the pupil to L- and M-cone signals. An examination of the phase relationships of the evoked responses revealed that melanopsin signals add with signals from L and M cones but are opposed by signals from S cones in control of the pupil. The opposition of the S cones is revealed in a seemingly paradoxical dilation of the pupil to greater S-cone photon capture. This surprising result is explained by the neurophysiological properties of ipRGCs found in animal studies.},

  abstract = {In mammals, a small population of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) plays a key role in the regulation of nonvisual photic responses, such as behavioral responses to light, pineal melatonin synthesis, pupillary light reflex, and sleep latency. These ipRGCs also express melanopsin (Opn4), a putative opsin-family photopigment that has been shown to play a role in mediating these nonvisual photic responses. Melanopsin is required for the function of this inner retinal pathway, but its precise role in generating photic responses has not yet been determined. We found that expression of melanopsin in Xenopus oocytes results in light-dependent activation of membrane currents through the G{$\alpha$}q/G{$\alpha$}11 G protein pathway, with an action spectrum closely matching that of melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs and of behavioral responses to light in mice lacking rods and cones. When coexpressed with arrestins, melanopsin could use all-trans-retinaldehyde as a chromophore, which suggests that it may function as a bireactive opsin. We also found that melanopsin could activate the cation channel TRPC3, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila phototransduction channels TRP and TRPL. Melanopsin therefore signals more like an invertebrate opsin than like a classical vertebrate rod-and-cone opsin.
In mammals, the opsin that detects light for circadian rhythms and pupil constriction activates signaling pathways that are similar to those used in invertebrates for vision.

  abstract = {The recent discovery of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) has led to a fundamental reassessment of non-image forming processing, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. In the conventional view of retinal physiology, rods and cones were assumed to be the only photoreceptors in the eye and were, therefore, considered responsible for non-image processing. However, signals from mRGCs contribute to this non-image forming processing along with cone-mediated luminance signals; although both signals contribute, it is unclear how these signals are summed. We designed and built a novel multi-primary stimulation system to stimulate mRGCs independently of other photoreceptors using a silent-substitution technique within a bright steady background. The system allows direct measurements of pupillary functions for mRGCs and cones. We observed a significant change in steady-state pupil diameter when we varied the excitation of mRGC alone, with no change in luminance and colour. Furthermore, the change in pupil diameter induced by mRGCs was larger than that induced by a variation in luminance alone: that is, for a bright steady background, the mRGC signals contribute to the pupillary pathway by a factor of three times more than the L- and M-cone signals.},

It is unknown if ipRGC activity is subject to extrinsic (central) or intrinsic (retinal) network-mediated circadian modulation during light entrainment and phase shifting. Eleven younger persons (18\textendash{}30 years) with no ophthalmological, medical or sleep disorders participated. The activity of the inner (ipRGC) and outer retina (cone photoreceptors) was assessed hourly using the pupil light reflex during a 24 h period of constant environmental illumination (10 lux). Exogenous circadian cues of activity, sleep, posture, caffeine, ambient temperature, caloric intake and ambient illumination were controlled. Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) was determined from salivary melatonin assay at hourly intervals, and participant melatonin onset values were set to 14 h to adjust clock time to circadian time. Here we demonstrate in humans that the ipRGC controlled post-illumination pupil response has a circadian rhythm independent of external light cues. This circadian variation precedes melatonin onset and the minimum ipRGC driven pupil response occurs post melatonin onset. Outer retinal photoreceptor contributions to the inner retinal ipRGC driven post-illumination pupil response also show circadian variation whereas direct outer retinal cone inputs to the pupil light reflex do not, indicating that intrinsically photosensitive (melanopsin) retinal ganglion cells mediate this circadian variation.},

  abstract = {Rods, cones and melanopsin containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) operate in concert to regulate pupil diameter. The temporal properties of intrinsic ipRGC signalling are distinct to those of rods and cones, including longer latencies and sustained signalling after light offset. We examined whether the melanopsin mediated post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) and pupil constriction were dependent upon the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between successive light pulses and the temporal frequency of sinusoidal light stimuli. Melanopsin excitation was altered by variation of stimulus wavelength (464nm and 638nm lights) and irradiance (11.4 and 15.2logphotonscm-2s-1). We found that 6s PIPR amplitude was independent of ISI and temporal frequency for all melanopsin excitation levels, indicating complete summation. In contrast to the PIPR, the maximum pupil constriction increased with increasing ISI with high and low melanopsin excitation, but time to minimum diameter was slower with high melanopsin excitation only. This melanopsin response to briefly presented pulses (16 and 100ms) slows the temporal response of the maximum pupil constriction. We also demonstrate that high melanopsin excitation attenuates the phasic peak-trough pupil amplitude compared to conditions with low melanopsin excitation, indicating an interaction between inner and outer retinal inputs to the pupil light reflex. We infer that outer retina summation is important for rapidly controlling pupil diameter in response to short timescale fluctuations in illumination and may occur at two potential sites, one that is presynaptic to extrinsic photoreceptor input to ipRGCs, or another within the pupil control pathway if ipRGCs have differential temporal tuning to extrinsic and intrinsic signalling.},

However, the photoreceptor contributions to the early redilation phase of the PIPR ({$<$} 6 s post-stimulus) have not been reported. Here, we evaluated the photoreceptor contributions to the early phase PIPR (0.6 s to 5.0 s) by measuring the spectral sensitivity of the criterion PIPR amplitude in response to 1 s light pulses at five narrowband stimulus wavelengths (409, 464, 508, 531 and 592 nm). The retinal irradiance producing a criterion PIPR was normalised to the peak and fitted by either a single photopigment nomogram or the combined melanopsin and rhodopsin spectral nomograms with the +L+M cone photopic luminous efficiency (V{$\lambda$}) function. We show that the PIPR spectral sensitivity at times {$\geq$} 1.7 s after light offset is best described by the melanopsin nomogram. At times {$<$} 1.7 s, the peak PIPR sensitivity shifts to longer wavelengths (range: 482 to 498 nm) and is best described by the combined photoreceptor nomogram, with major contributions from melanopsin and rhodopsin. This first report of melanopsin and rhodopsin contributions to the early phase PIPR is in line with the electrophysiological findings of ipRGC and rod signalling after the cessation of light stimuli and provides a cut-off time for isolating photoreceptor specific function in healthy and diseased eyes.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms of light adaptation have been traditionally explained with reference to psychophysical experimentation. However, the neural substrata involved in those mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Our study analyzed links between psychophysical measurements and retinal physiological evidence with consideration for the phenomena of rod-cone interactions, photon noise, and spatial summation. Threshold test luminances were obtained with steady background fields at mesopic and photopic light levels (i.e., 0.06\textendash{}110cd/m2) for retinal eccentricities from 0\textdegree{} to 15\textdegree{} using three combinations of background/test field sizes (i.e., 10\textdegree/2\textdegree, 10\textdegree/0.45\textdegree, and 1\textdegree/0.45\textdegree{}). A two-channel Maxwellian view optical system was employed to eliminate pupil effects on the measured thresholds. A model based on visual mechanisms that were described in the literature was optimized to fit the measured luminance thresholds in all experimental conditions. Our results can be described by a combination of visual mechanisms. We determined how spatial summation changed with eccentricity and how subtractive adaptation changed with eccentricity and background field size. According to our model, photon noise plays a significant role to explain contrast detection thresholds measured with the 1/0.45\textdegree{} background/test size combination at mesopic luminances and at off-axis eccentricities. In these conditions, our data reflect the presence of rod-cone interaction for eccentricities between 6\textdegree{} and 9\textdegree{} and luminances between 0.6 and 5cd/m2. In spite of the increasing noise effects with eccentricity, results also show that the visual system tends to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio in the off-axis detection task over the whole mesopic range.},

  abstract = {Tablet computer displays are amenable for the development of vision tests in a portable form. Assessing color vision using an easily accessible and portable test may help in the self-monitoring of vision-related changes in ocular/systemic conditions and assist in the early detection of disease processes. Tablet computer-based games were developed with different levels of gamification as a more portable option to assess chromatic contrast sensitivity. Game 1 was designed as a clinical version with no gaming elements. Game 2 was a gamified version of game 1 (added fun elements: feedback, scores, and sounds) and game 3 was a complete game with vision task nested within. The current study aimed to determine the normative values and evaluate repeatability of the tablet computer-based games in comparison with an established test, the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) Trivector test. Normally sighted individuals [N = 100, median (range) age 19.0 years (18\textendash{}56 years)] had their chromatic contrast sensitivity evaluated binocularly using the three games and the CCT. Games 1 and 2 and the CCT showed similar absolute thresholds and tolerance intervals, and game 3 had significantly lower values than games 1, 2, and the CCT, due to visual task differences. With the exception of game 3 for blue-yellow, the CCT and tablet computer-based games showed similar repeatability with comparable 95\% limits of agreement. The custom-designed games are portable, rapid, and may find application in routine clinical practice, especially for testing younger populations.},

The current study aimed to understand how gamification affects the user experience, specifically during the undertaking of psychophysical tasks designed to estimate vision thresholds (chromatic and achromatic contrast sensitivity). Methods: Three tablet computer-based games were developed with three levels of gaming elements. Game 1 was designed to be a simple clinical test (no gaming elements), game 2 was similar to game 1 but with added gaming elements (i.e., feedback, scores, and sounds), and game 3 was a complete game. Participants (N\,=\,144, age: 9.9\textendash{}42 years) played three games in random order. The user experience for each game was assessed using a Short Feedback Questionnaire. Results: The median (interquartile range) fun level for the three games was 2.5 (1.6), 3.9 (1.7), and 2.5 (2.8), respectively. Overall, participants reported greater fun level and higher preparedness to play the game again for game 2 than games 1 and 3 (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). There were significant positive correlations observed between fun level and preparedness to play the game again for all the games (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Engagement (assessed as completion rates) did not differ between the games. Conclusion: Gamified version (game 2) was preferred to the other two versions. Over the short term, the careful application of gaming elements to vision tests was found to increase the fun level of users, without affecting engagement with the vision test.},

  abstract = {Colors defined by the two intermediate directions in color space, ``orange\textendash{}cyan'' and ``lime\textendash{}magenta,'' elicit the same spatiotemporal average response from the two cardinal chromatic channels in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). While we found LGN functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to these pairs of colors were statistically indistinguishable, primary visual cortex (V1) fMRI responses were stronger to orange\textendash{}cyan. Moreover, linear combinations of single-cell responses to cone-isolating stimuli of V1 cone-opponent cells also yielded stronger predicted responses to orange\textendash{}cyan over lime\textendash{}magenta, suggesting these neurons underlie the fMRI result. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that V1 recombines LGN signals into ``higher-order'' mechanisms tuned to noncardinal color directions. In light of work showing that natural images and daylight samples are biased toward orange\textendash{}cyan, our findings further suggest that V1 is adapted to daylight. V1, especially double-opponent cells, may function to extract spatial information from color boundaries correlated with scene-structure cues, such as shadows lit by ambient blue sky juxtaposed with surfaces reflecting sunshine.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells are intrinsically photosensitive cells that are involved in non-image forming visual processes such as the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment but also contribute to visual perception. Here we used immunohistochemistry to study the morphology, density, distribution, and synaptic connectivity of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in four post mortem human donor retinas. Two types of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells were distinguished based on their dendritic stratification near either the outer or the inner border of the inner plexiform layer. Outer stratifying cells make up on average 60\% of the melanopsin-expressing cells. About half of the melanopsin-expressing cells (or 80\% of the outer stratifying cells) have their soma displaced to the inner nuclear layer. Inner stratifying cells have their soma exclusively in the ganglion cell layer and include a small proportion of bistratified cells. The dendritic field diameter of melanopsin-expressing cells ranges from 250 (near the fovea) to 1,000\,{$\mathrm{\mu}$}m in peripheral retina. The dendritic trees of outer stratifying cells cover the retina independent of soma location. The dendritic fields of both outer and inner stratifying cells show a high degree of overlap with a coverage factor of approximately two. Melanopsin-expressing cells occur at an average peak density of between {$\sim$}20 and {$\sim$}40 cells/mm2 at about 2\,mm eccentricity, the density drops to below {$\sim$}10 cells/mm2 at about 8\,mm eccentricity. Both the outer and inner stratifying dendrites express postsynaptic density (PSD95) immunoreactive puncta suggesting that they receive synaptic input from bipolar cells.},

  abstract = {There is theoretical and empirical support for long-term adaptation of human vision to chromatic regularities in the environment. The current study investigates whether relationships of luminance and chromaticity in the natural environment could drive chromatic adaptation independently and differently for bright and dark colors. This is motivated by psychophysical evidence of systematic difference shifts in red\textendash{}green chromatic sensitivities between contextually bright- versus dark-colored stimuli. For some broad classes of scene content, consistent shifts in chromaticity are found between high and low light levels within images. Especially in those images in which sky and terrain are juxtaposed, this shift has direction and magnitude consistent with the observed psychophysical shifts in the red\textendash{}green balance between bright and dark colors. Taken together, these findings suggest that relative weighting of M- and L-cone signals could be adapted, in a luminance-dependent fashion, to regularities in the natural environment.},

  issn = {1552-5783},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the light sensitivity of poorly reflective cones observed in retinas of normal subjects, and to establish a relationship between cone reflectivity and perceptual threshold.
METHODS: Five subjects (four male, one female) with normal vision were imaged longitudinally (7-26 imaging sessions, representing 82-896 days) using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to monitor cone reflectance. Ten cones with unusually low reflectivity, as well as 10 normally reflective cones serving as controls, were targeted for perceptual testing. Cone-sized stimuli were delivered to the targeted cones and luminance increment thresholds were quantified. Thresholds were measured three to five times per session for each cone in the 10 pairs, all located 2.2 to 3.3\textdegree{} from the center of gaze.
RESULTS: Compared with other cones in the same retinal area, three of 10 monitored dark cones were persistently poorly reflective, while seven occasionally manifested normal reflectance. Tested psychophysically, all 10 dark cones had thresholds comparable with those from normally reflecting cones measured concurrently (P = 0.49). The variation observed in dark cone thresholds also matched the wide variation seen in a large population (n = 56 cone pairs, six subjects) of normal cones; in the latter, no correlation was found between cone reflectivity and threshold (P = 0.0502).
CONCLUSIONS: Low cone reflectance cannot be used as a reliable indicator of cone sensitivity to light in normal retinas. To improve assessment of early retinal pathology, other diagnostic criteria should be employed along with imaging and cone-based microperimetry.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that light sources with chromaticities slightly below the blackbody locus are preferred by human observers. The preferred light settings identified in these studies, however, had high values of colour fidelity and colour gamut. It has been speculated that the preference was caused by good colour rendition, rather than chromaticity. This article reports a pilot study in which the spectral power distributions of the light settings were carefully designed using a genetic algorithm. Twenty-three observers evaluated pairs of light settings at 3000\,K and 6500\,K with different chromaticities, in terms of Duv, but similar colour rendition as characterized using the IES TM-30-15 Rf, Rg, and Color Vector Graphic. It was found that the light settings with Duv of -0.02 and -0.03 were most preferred among the 3000\,K settings; while the settings with Duv of 0 and -0.01 were most preferred among the 6500\,K settings. Further studies regarding how chromaticity alone affects preference under different viewing conditions and adaptation conditions will be valuable to better understand human preference for light stimuli.},

  issn = {1477-1535},
  abstract = {Colour preference for lighting is generally influenced by three kinds of contextual factors, the light, the object and the observer. In this study, a series of psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate and compare the effect of certain factors on colour preference, including spectral power distribution of light, lighting application, observers' personal colour preference, regional cultural difference and gender difference. LED lights with different correlated colour temperatures were used to illuminate a wide selection of objects. Participant response was quantified by a 7-point rating method or a 5-level ranking method. It was found that the preferred illumination for different objects exhibited a similar trend and that the influence of light was significantly stronger than that of other factors. Therefore, we conclude that the light itself (rather than, e.g. the objects that are viewed) is the most crucial factor for predicting which light, among several candidates with different correlated colour temperatures, an observer will prefer. In addition, some of the gamut-based colour quality metrics correlated well with the participants' response, which corroborates the view that colour preference is strongly influenced by colour saturation. The familiarity of the object affects the ratings for each experiment while the colour of the objects also influences colour preference.},

  abstract = {A red/green equilibrium light is one which appears neither reddish nor greenish (i.e. either uniquely yellow, uniquely blue, or achromatic). A subset of spectral and nonspectral red/green equilibria was determined for several luminance levels, in order to test whether the set of all such equilibria is closed under linear color-mixture operations.
The spectral loci of equilibrium yellow and blue showed either no variation or visually insignificant variation over a range of 1\textendash{}2 log10 unit. There were no trends that were repeatable across observers. We concluded that spectral red/green equilibria are closed under scalar multiplication; consequently they are invariant hues relative to the Bezold-Br{\"u}cke shift.
The additive mixture of yellow and blue equilibrium wavelengths, in any luminance ratio, is also an equilibrium light. Small changes of the yellowish component of a mixture toward redness or greeness must be compensated by predictable changes of the bluish component of the mixture toward greenness or redness. We concluded that yellow and blue equilibria are complementary relative to an equilibrium white; that desaturation of a yellow or blue equilibrium light with such a white produces no Abney hue shift; and that the set of red/green equilibria is closed under general linear operations.
One consequence is that the red/green chromatic-response function, measured by the Jameson-Hurvich technique of cancellation to equilibrium, is a linear function of the individual's color-matching coordinates. A second consequence of linear closure of equilibria is a strong constraint on the class of combination rules by which receptor outputs are recoded into the red/green opponent process.},

  abstract = {Summary
Melanopsin photoreception enhances retinal responses to variations in ambient light (irradiance) and drives non-image-forming visual reflexes such as circadian entrainment [1\textendash{}6]. Melanopsin signals also reach brain regions responsible for form vision [7\textendash{}9], but melanopsin's contribution, if any, to encoding visual images remains unclear. We addressed this deficit using principles of receptor silent substitution to present images in which visibility for melanopsin versus rods+cones was independently modulated, and we recorded evoked responses in the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN; thalamic relay for cortical vision). Approximately 20\% of dLGN units responded to patterns visible only to melanopsin, revealing that melanopsin signals alone can convey spatial information. Spatial receptive fields (RFs) mapped using~melanopsin-isolating stimuli had ON centers with diameters {$\sim$}13\textdegree. Melanopsin and rod+cone responses differed in the temporal domain, and responses to slow changes in radiance (\&lt;0.9~Hz) and stationary images were deficient when stimuli were rendered invisible for melanopsin. We employed these data to devise and test a mathematical model of melanopsin's involvement in form vision and applied it, along with further experimental recordings, to explore melanopsin signals under simulated active view of natural scenes. Our findings reveal that melanopsin enhances the thalamic representation of scenes containing local correlations in radiance, compensating for the high temporal frequency bias of cone vision and the negative correlation between magnitude and frequency for changes in direction of view. Together, these data reveal a distinct melanopsin contribution to encoding visual images, predicting that, under natural view, melanopsin augments the early visual system's ability to encode patterns over moderate spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The photopigment melanopsin supports reflexive visual functions in people, such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. What contribution melanopsin makes to conscious visual perception is less studied. We devised a stimulus that targeted melanopsin separately from the cones using pulsed (3 s) spectral modulations around a photopic background. Pupillometry confirmed that the melanopsin stimulus drives a retinal mechanism distinct from luminance. In each of four subjects, a functional MRI response in area V1 was found. This response scaled with melanopic contrast and was not easily explained by imprecision in the silencing of the cones. Twenty additional subjects then observed melanopsin pulses and provided a structured rating of the perceptual experience. Melanopsin stimulation was described as an unpleasant, blurry, minimal brightening that quickly faded. We conclude that isolated stimulation of melanopsin is likely associated with a response within the cortical visual pathway and with an evoked conscious percept.},

The new model, which is based on a combination of local and global anchoring of lightness values, appears to provide an unprecedented account of a wide range of empirical results, both classical and recent, especially the pattern of errors. It provides a unified account of both illumination-dependent failures of constancy and background-dependent failures of constancy, resolving a number of long-standing puzzles.},

In the first, two side-by-side booths were designed to resemble a retail setting with clothing; in the second, a single booth was designed to resemble a restaurant setting, but also included a mirror to permit the observer's evaluation of skin tone. These settings were illuminated with two sets of sources, where, compared to a fixed reference, one set created modest chroma enhancement and the other set created greater increases in object chroma. Within each set, gamut shape varied, meaning different hues were saturated, even though, on average, the spectra created the same average increase in chroma. When objects were unfamiliar, as with the fabrics, all chroma-enhancing spectra were preferred to the fixed reference regardless of the gamut shapes. When familiar objects were present, such as food, observers were more discerning about changes in chroma and hue. We conclude that a graphic of gamut shape is an important adjunct to average measures of colour fidelity and gamut.},

  issn = {1477-1535},
  abstract = {An experiment was conducted to evaluate how subjective impressions of a light source's colour quality depend upon the details of the shifts it causes in the colour appearance of illuminated objects. Twenty-eight participants each evaluated 26 lighting conditions in a 3.1\,m by 3.7\,m room filled with objects selected to cover a range of hue, saturation, and lightness. IES TM-30-15 Fidelity Index (Rf) values ranged from 64 to 93, IES TM-30 Gamut Index (Rg) values ranging from 79 to 117, and IES TM-30 red chroma shift (Rcs,h1) values ranging from -19\% to 26\%. All lighting conditions had the same nominal illuminance and chromaticity. Participants were asked to rate each condition on eight point scales for saturated\textendash{}dull, normal\textendash{}shifted, and like\textendash{}dislike, as well as classifying the condition as one of saturated, dull, normal, or shifted. The findings suggest that gamut shape is more important than average gamut area for modeling human preference, with red playing a more important role than other hues. Average fidelity alone is a weak predictor of human perception, especially CIE Ra. Nine of the top 12 rated products had a CIE Ra value of 73 or less, which indicates that the criteria of CIE Ra\,{$\geq$}\,80 may be excluding many preferred light sources.},

This result has surprised us since we have previously used the better of these algorithms successfully to correct the colour balance of images for display. Colour balancing has been the typical application of colour constancy, rarely has it been actually put to use in a computer vision system, so our goal was to show how well the various methods would do on an obvious machine colour vision task, namely, object recognition. Although all the colour constancy methods we tested proved insufficient for the task, we consider this an important finding in itself. In addition we present results showing the correlation between colour constancy performance and object recognition performance, and as one might expect, the better the colour constancy the better the recognition rate.},

Particularly interesting is to understand the unique contribution to the visual signal brought by cone bipolar cells, neurons typical of the mammalian retina and especially dedicated to receive synaptic input from cones. In all the species studied so far, it has been shown that cone bipolar cells occur in about ten different types, which form distinct clusters identified with a panel of both classical and modern genetic methods. Reviewed here is current literature illustrating the occurrence of morphological, molecular and architectural features that confer to each bipolar cell type exclusive fingerprints, ultimately predicting the emergence of similarly unique, albeit still partially unraveled, functional properties. Thus, differences among cone bipolar cells lay the ground for the genesis in the outer retina of parallel channels, which convey to the inner retina separate information, among others, about contrast, chromatic features and temporal properties of the visual signal.},

  issn = {0027-8424, 1091-6490},
  abstract = {Ganglion cells (GCs) are fundamental to retinal neural circuitry, processing photoreceptor signals for transmission to the brain via their axons. However, much remains unknown about their role in vision and their vulnerability to disease leading to blindness. A major bottleneck has been our inability to observe GCs and their degeneration in the living human eye. Despite two decades of development of optical technologies to image cells in the living human retina, GCs remain elusive due to their high optical translucency. Failure of conventional imaging\textemdash{}using predominately singly scattered light\textemdash{}to reveal GCs has led to a focus on multiply-scattered, fluorescence, two-photon, and phase imaging techniques to enhance GC contrast. Here, we show that singly scattered light actually carries substantial information that reveals GC somas, axons, and other retinal neurons and permits their quantitative analysis. We perform morphometry on GC layer somas, including projection of GCs onto photoreceptors and identification of the primary GC subtypes, even beneath nerve fibers. We obtained singly scattered images by: (i) marrying adaptive optics to optical coherence tomography to avoid optical blurring of the eye; (ii) performing 3D subcellular image registration to avoid motion blur; and (iii) using organelle motility inside somas as an intrinsic contrast agent. Moreover, through-focus imaging offers the potential to spatially map individual GCs to underlying amacrine, bipolar, horizontal, photoreceptor, and retinal pigment epithelium cells, thus exposing the anatomical substrate for neural processing of visual information. This imaging modality is also a tool for improving clinical diagnosis and assessing treatment of retinal disease.},

Mankind has evolved over many, many, thousands of years under daylight; that is light directly from the sun and by reflection. Daylight has a broad, relatively smooth spectral distribution embracing the full colour range of the human visual system. Electric illumination has been available for barely 100 years and has developed considerably from the humble incandescent light bulb through discharge sources and now solid state light emitting devices but its measurement systems are based on a much narrower spectral distribution, agreed internationally in 1924, the CIE V{$\lambda$} distribution. Systems of colour measurement came much later, but are considered insufficiently accurately for modern light sources. Possible alternatives are considered. It also explores the human response to light and colour with respect to environment design.},

  abstract = {Today, many digital reproductions of artefacts can be seen while surfing the internet. The question investigated in this chapter is whether there is a substantial colour difference between the digital reproductions of the artefacts downloaded from several online databases and the original works. Tests and measurements aimed to explore the reasons for the differences, which were detected and are described.
Six paintings were selected for detailed investigation. Representative coloured patches were measured on these reproductions from the internet, displaying them in three popular web browsers, and the data sets were compared.
Results from this research demonstrate that there are significant differences between the original artefacts and their digital reproductions, and there is a significant difference between the different web browsers. The source of this difference is very complex. One is the difference between the displaying techniques of the various web browsers, which produces a relevant aberration in colour rendering. This consequence can arise from the JPEG encoding and decoding methods. Implicit use of colour spaces in browsers, missing or incorrect EXIF data, and noncalibrated displays together can result in very different forms of colour representation.},

  abstract = {The reaction of wavelength-selective (WL), wavelength-opponent (WLO) and colour-coded (CO) cells 8 in monkey visual cortex to changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from the area in their receptive fields was studied, using multicoloured displays. Wavelength-selective and wavelength-opponent cells were found to be very sensitive to changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from the areas in their receptive fields, irrespective of their perceived natural and void colours. 8 Changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from surrounding areas did not affect their responses. They were also sensitive to the order in which lights of various wavelengths illuminated the areas in their receptive fields. Colour-coded cells were not affected by changes in the wavelength composition nor were they sensitive to the sequence with which the area in their receptive fields was illuminated by lights of different wavelengths. However, they required that the display, with the area of their preferred colour in their receptive fields, be trichromatically illuminated. This and other evidence suggested that such cells were sensitive not only to the illumination of the area in their receptive fields, but of surrounding areas as well. This evidence reinforces further the distinction between wavelength-selective and colour-coded cells and leads to the conclusion that one function of the wavelength-selective cells must be to register the changes in wavelength composition which occur throughout the day.},

  shorttitle = {Understanding {{The New Statistics}}},
  abstract = {This is the first book to introduce the new statistics - effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis - in an accessible way. It is chock full of practical examples and tips on how to analyze and report research results using these techniques. The book is invaluable to readers interested in meeting the new APA Publication Manual guidelines by adopting the new statistics - which are more informative than null hypothesis significance testing, and becoming widely used in many disciplines. Accompanying the book is the Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals (ESCI) package, free software that runs under Excel and is accessible at www.thenewstatistics.com. The book's exercises use ESCI's simulations, which are highly visual and interactive, to engage users and encourage exploration. Working with the simulations strengthens understanding of key statistical ideas. There are also many examples, and detailed guidance to show readers how to analyze their own data using the new statistics, and practical strategies for interpreting the results. A particular strength of the book is its explanation of meta-analysis, using simple diagrams and examples. Understanding meta-analysis is increasingly important, even at undergraduate levels, because medicine, psychology and many other disciplines now use meta-analysis to assemble the evidence needed for evidence-based practice. The book's pedagogical program, built on cognitive science principles, reinforces learning: Boxes provide "evidence-based" advice on the most effective statistical techniques. Numerous examples reinforce learning, and show that many disciplines are using the new statistics. Graphs are tied in with ESCI to make important concepts vividly clear and memorable. Opening overviews and end of chapter take-home messages summarize key points. Exercises encourage exploration, deep understanding, and practical applications. This highly accessible book is intended as the core text for any course that emphasizes the new statistics, or as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses in statistics and research methods in departments of psychology, education, human development , nursing, and natural, social, and life sciences. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the new statistics, and future published research, will also appreciate this book. A basic familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed.},

While the former is a well-studied factor in synchronizing behavior and physiology to the earth's 24-hour rotation, color sensitivity in the regulation of circadian rhythms has not been systematically studied. Drawing on the concept of color opponency, a well-known property of image-forming vision in many vertebrates (including humans), we consider how the spectral shifts during twilight are encoded by a color-opponent sensory system for non-image-forming (NIF) visual functions including phase shifting and melatonin suppression. We review electrophysiological evidence for color sensitivity in the pineal/parietal organs of fish, amphibians and reptiles, color coding in neurons in the circadian pacemaker in mice as well as sporadic evidence for color sensitivity in NIF visual functions in birds and other mammals. Together, these studies suggest that color opponency in may be an important modulator of light-driven physiological and behavioral responses.},

What contribution melanopsin makes to conscious visual perception is less studied. We devised a stimulus that targeted melanopsin separately from the cones using pulsed (3-s) spectral modulations around a photopic background. Pupillometry confirmed that the melanopsin stimulus evokes a response different from that produced by cone stimulation. In each of four subjects, a functional MRI response in area V1 was found. This response scaled with melanopic contrast and was not easily explained by imprecision in the silencing of the cones. Twenty additional subjects then observed melanopsin pulses and provided a structured rating of the perceptual experience. Melanopsin stimulation was described as an unpleasant, blurry, minimal brightening that quickly faded. We conclude that isolated stimulation of melanopsin is likely associated with a response within the cortical visual pathway and with an evoked conscious percept.},

  abstract = {For colour vision, the task of the eye is to discriminate different distributions of energy over the spectrum. This is usually treated as a problem in the wavelength domain, analogous to treating spatial resolution in terms of spatial positions in the image. What is attempted here is a treatment of colour vision in terms of the system's responses to spectral energy distributions that are sinusoidal functions of wavelength. These are called comb-filtered spectra, and the treatment is analogous to that of spatial vision in terms of spatial sinusoids. This gives some insight into the reasons for trichromacy, the advantages of oil droplets, and the narrow separation of the red and green mechanisms. It is also shown that the absorption spectra of photosensitive pigments are superimposable if plotted as a function of the fourth root of wavelength.},

@article{corney_brightness_2009,
  title = {The {{Brightness}} of {{Colour}}},
  volume = {4},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Background
The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (HK) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this `illusion' to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use fMRI brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related fMRI studies.

Results
Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the HK effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with fMRI.

Conclusions
The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond.},

  abstract = {Despite great efforts over several decades, our best models of primary visual cortex (V1) still predict neural responses quite poorly when probed with natural stimuli, highlighting our limited understanding of the nonlinear computations in V1. At the same time, recent advances in machine learning have shown that deep neural networks can learn highly nonlinear functions for visual information processing. Two approaches based on deep learning have recently been successfully applied to neural data: transfer learning for predicting neural activity in higher areas of the primate ventral stream and data-driven models to predict retina and V1 neural activity of mice. However, so far there exists no comparison between the two approaches and neither of them has been used to model the early primate visual system. Here, we test the ability of both approaches to predict neural responses to natural images in V1 of awake monkeys. We found that both deep learning approaches outperformed classical linear- nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations building on existing V1 encoding theories. On our dataset, transfer learning and data-driven models performed similarly, while the data-driven model employed a much simpler architecture. Thus, multi-layer CNNs set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses to natural images in primate V1. Having such good predictive in-silico models opens the door for quantitative studies of yet unknown nonlinear computations in V1 without being limited by the available experimental time.},

However, the same scene viewed under two different lights with respect to which the same algorithm delivers illuminant estimates and then identical reproductions-and so, the practical estimation error is the same-can, in fact and counterintuitively, result in quite different recovery errors. Reproduction angular error has been recently introduced as an improvement to recovery angular error. The new metric calculates the angle between the RGB values of a white surface corrected by the ground truth illuminant and corrected by the estimated illuminant. Experiments show that illumi-nant estimation algorithms could be ranked differently depending on whether they are evaluated by recovery or reproduction angular error. In this paper a psychophysical experiment is designed which demonstrates that observers choices on 'what makes a good reproduction' correlates with reproduction error and not recovery error.},

Before supplementation, the tests revealed borderline performance for photopic and mesopic visual acuity (VA), functional contrast sensitivity (FCS) and red / green (RG) colour vision. The subject's thresholds for yellow-blue (YB) colour vision and rod sensitivity were, however, just above normal, age-matched limits. Post supplementation, the results revealed increased macular pigment levels in the central retina. In addition, the results also revealed significant improvements in several, other aspects of vision, particularly at lower light levels. VA and FCS improved, but this outcome depended on whether the stimuli were of positive or negative luminance contrast. Rod and cone mediated vision showed significant changes with large improvements in rod sensitivity. Thresholds for detection of RG and particularly YB colours were also significantly lower post-supplementation.},

We measured reflectance spectra from the fur and skin of many primate species in order to provide an objective survey of the possibilities of pelage coloration found in extant primates. We show that the orange coloration displayed by many platyrrhine and some strepsirhine primates, while being conspicuous to humans, would be cryptic amongst foliage to all males and many females of their own species. In relation to this finding, we briefly review what is known of the color vision of birds that prey on primates, and assess how conspicuous the orange pelage would be to these predators. Am. J.

The colour vision of many primates is trichromatic, whereas that of all other mammals is thought to be dichromatic or monochromatic. Moreover, the triplets of cone pigments in different catarrhines (Old World apes and monkeys) are strikingly similar in their spectral positions. We ask whether the selective advantage of trichromacy lies in an enhanced ability to find edible leaves or fruit. Further, we ask whether any factor in these two search tasks has constrained the particular set of cone spectral sensitivities observed in all catarrhines. We measured the spectral properties of the natural environments of six primate species in Uganda: Pan troglodytes, Cercopithecus mitis, Cercopithecus ascanius, Lophocebus albigena, Colobus guereza and Colobus badius. We concentrated on the fruit and leaves in their diets and the leaves of the trees that make up the background against which these diet items must be found. We plotted these measured stimuli in colour spaces appropriate for each primate species, and found that both frugivory and folivory are facilitated by the extra dimension of colour vision found in catarrhines but lacking in most other mammals. Furthermore, by treating the task of searching for food as a signal-detection task, we show that, of all possible combinations of cone sensitivities, the spectral positions of the actual primate pigments are optimal for finding fruit or young leaves against the background of mature leaves. This is because the variance of the chromaticities of the mature leaves is minimised in one channel of the primate's colour vision, so allowing anything that is not a mature leaf to stand out.},

We have measured the reflectance spectra of many samples of fruit eaten by chimpanzees and three frugivorous monkey species. If the fruit are plotted in a colour space appropriate for catarrhine primates, several distinct ripening patterns are evident. The degree of ripeness of many species would be discernible by dichromatic primates, but for most fruit a trichromatic consumer would be at an advantage. However, by calculating which set of possible photopigments would maximise the chromatic distance between samples of each fruit species, we show that the spectral positions of the primate long- (L) and middle-wavelength (M) cone pigments are not optimised for this task.},

  abstract = {Estimating local surface orientation (slant and tilt) is fundamental to recovering the three-dimensional structure of the environment, but it is unknown how well humans perform this task in natural scenes. Here, with a high-fidelity database of natural stereo-images with groundtruth surface orientation at each pixel, we find dramatic differences in human tilt estimation with natural and artificial stimuli. With artificial stimuli, estimates are precise and unbiased. With natural stimuli, estimates are imprecise and strongly biased. An image-computable normative model grounded in natural scene statistics predicts human bias, precision, and trial-by-trial errors without fitting parameters to the human data. These similarities suggest that the complex human performance patterns with natural stimuli are lawful, and that human visual systems have internalized local image and scene statistics to optimally infer the three-dimensional structure of the environment. The current results help generalize our understanding of human vision from the lab to the real world.},

  abstract = {Colors often appear to differ in arbitrary ways among related species. However, a fraction of color diversity may be explained because some signals are more easily perceived in one environment rather than another. Models show that not only signals but also the perception of signals should regularly evolve in response to different environments, whether these primarily involve detection of conspecifics or detection of predators and prey. Thus, a deeper understanding of how perception of color correlates with environmental attributes should help generate more predictive models of color divergence. Here, I briefly review our understanding of color vision in vertebrates. Then I focus on opsin spectral tuning and opsin expression, two traits involved in color perception that have become amenable to study. I ask how opsin tuning is correlated with ecological differences, notably the light environment, and how this potentially affects perception of conspecific colors. Although opsin tuning appears to evolve slowly, opsin expression levels are more evolutionarily labile but have been difficult to connect to color perception. The challenge going forward will be to identify how physiological differences involved in color vision, such as opsin expression levels, translate into perceptual differences, the selection pressures that have driven those differences, and ultimately how this may drive evolution of conspecific colors.},

However, the perceived brightness of different sources is not always predicted by their respective luminance [ 8\textendash{}12 ].

  abstract = {Author Summary The human visual system encodes color by comparing the responses of three different kinds of photoreceptors: the long- (reddish), medium- (greenish), and short- (bluish) wavelength-sensitive cone cells. In order for the visual system to accurately represent the color of stimuli, it must (in effect) know the class of the cone that produced each response. The long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive cones, however, are virtually identical in every known way except that their responses to a given spectrum of light differ. Here, we simulate cones in a model human retina and show that by examining the correlation of the responses of cones to natural scenes, it is possible to determine both the number cone classes present in a retinal mosaic and to explicitly determine the class of each cone.

  volume = {55},
  issn = {1552-5783},
  abstract = {Purpose: Photopic vision arises from L, M and S cones as well as from the recently discovered intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing the photopigment melanopsin. Much is known about the brain pathways of signals originating from cones. Considerably less is known about the projections of the ipRGCs, in particular in the human brain. Here we used BOLD fMRI to measure neural responses in humans to spectral modulations that selectively target melanopsin while minimizing the responses of the cones, and compare these to responses generated using cone-targeted spectral modulations.

Methods: Four observers viewed large-field (27.5\textdegree{} diameter, central 5\textdegree{} obscured) sinusoidal flicker (1-16 Hz, log spaced) at 470 cd/m2 during BOLD fMRI. Using the method of silent substitution and a digital light synthesizer, spectral modulations were directed at melanopsin, L+M, L-M, or S cones. An isochromatic modulation (L+M+S+melanopsin) was also studied. Estimates of photopigment spectral sensitivities used to produce modulations accounted for observer age and stimulus extent. Anatomical regions of interest were defined for the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; using volumetric templates), for primary visual cortex (V1) and for extrastriate areas (V2, V3 and hV4) (Benson VSS2013). Cortical voxels were restricted to {$>$}5\textdegree{} eccentricity as an extra precaution against contamination from changes in cone spectral sensitivity at the fovea. Temporal transfer functions (TTFs), describing the BOLD response as a function of temporal frequency for each modulation direction, were averaged for the four observers.

Results: We found robust melanopsin-driven responses in both LGN and V1-hV4. In LGN, the melanopsin response was bandpass, maximal at 8 Hz with no measurable response below 2 Hz. The melanopsin response in V1 and V2 through hV4 was also bandpass. Across areas the responses to cone-directed stimuli differed with the direction of the spectral modulation, and differed as well from the responses to melanopsin stimulation. S-cone responses were distinct from melanopsin responses in both LGN and cortex.

Conclusions: Signals originating in the melanopsin-containing ipRGCs produce robust responses in the LGN and visual cortex of the human brain. The TTFs for melanopsin-driven responses are bandpass in both LGN and visual cortex. The responses tomelanopsin-driven stimulation have a temporal signature distinct from that of cone-driven responses.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of visual coding have been successfully predicted by starting from the statistics of natural scenes and then asking how the stimulus could be efficiently represented. We started from the representation of color characterized by uniform color spaces, and then asked what type of color environment they implied. These spaces are designed to represent equal perceptual differences in color discrimination or appearance by equal distances in the space. The relative sensitivity to different axes within the space might therefore reflect the gamut of colors in natural scenes. To examine this, we projected perceptually uniform distributions within the Munsell, CIE L*u*v* or CIE L*a*b* spaces into cone-opponent space. All were elongated along a bluish-yellowish axis reflecting covarying signals along the L\textendash{}M and S\textendash{}(L+M) cardinal axes, a pattern typical (though not identical) to many natural environments. In turn, color distributions from environments were more uniform when projected into the CIE L*a*b* perceptual space than when represented in a normalized cone-opponent space. These analyses suggest the bluish-yellowish bias in environmental colors might be an important factor shaping chromatic sensitivity, and also suggest that perceptually uniform color metrics could be derived from natural scene statistics and potentially tailored to specific environments.},

The resulting clear-sky chromaticities in 44 different view directions (1) are close to but do not coincide with the CIE daylight locus, (2) form V-shaped meridional chromaticity curves along it (as expected from theory), and (3) have correlated color temperatures (CCT's) ranging from 3800 K to {$\infty$} K. We also routinely observe that sky color and luminance are asymmetric about the solar meridian, usually perceptibly so. A principal-components analysis shows that three vectors are required for accurate clear-sky colorimetry, whereas six are needed for spectral analyses.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what' and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual cortex.},

The derivation was historical and could be traced to pioneering work in photographic sensitometry, vacuum tube physics, and broadcast television. By performing radiometric measurements relative to a display's maximum exitance, the model simplified to a two-stage model. The first stage was a nonlinear transformation relating normalized digital-to-analog converter values to device-dependent monitor tristimulus values using model parameters of gain, offset, and {$\gamma$}. The second stage was a linear transformation where the device-dependent monitor tristimulus values were transformed to device-independent CIE tristimulus values. By using the model, colorimetric characterization accuracy of better than 0.5 CIELAB color-difference units for 125 colors sampling the display color gamut was achieved by measuring the CIE tristimulus values of only eight colors. The model had equivalent performance to methods using extensive measurements and table lookup. \textcopyright{} 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Precision and accuracy requirements for photometers, colorimeters, and spectroradiometers were evaluated. When models are used to relate digital counts defining a stimulus and resulting spectral radiant exitance, displays are assumed to exhibit channel and spatial independence. A variety of tests and the results of evaluating four imaging systems are described. From these analyses, measurement accuracy is mainly limited by wavelength scale in the case of spectro-radiometers and filter fit in the case of colorimeters. Measurement precision is limited by the number of significant figures for fixed-range devices and signal-to-noise limitations for low-luminance stimuli. Display accuracy is limited by a lack of channel and spatial independence. Display precision is mainly limited by the electronic design of the display and the stability and load independence of the gun amplifiers. \textcopyright{} 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

A new model was developed for the S-shaped electro-optical transfer function of the LCD device, and was extended to predict the anomalous colour tracking of the primaries.},

Methods based on piecewise linear interpolation were found to yield better accuracy than others based on linear regression.

Evidence was also obtained concerning the number of CRT measurement points needed to obtain maximum accuracy from the interpolation-based methods.

  title = {Colorimetric Characterization of a Computer-Controlled Liquid Crystal Display},
  volume = {29},
  issn = {1520-6378},
  abstract = {A new method was used to characterize computer-controlled liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The characterization, which was performed to enable colorimetric image display, included channel independence, spatial independence, screen uniformity, and colorimetry. The colorimetric model consisted of three one-dimensional look-up tables (LUTs) describing each channel's optoelectronic transfer function and a 3 \texttimes{} 4 matrix transformation that included black-level flare. The matrix coefficients were estimated statistically by minimizing the average CIEDE2000 color difference for a data set sampling the display's colorimetric gamut. The LUTs were recreated dynamically throughout the optimization of the matrix coefficients. The characterization was implemented with three different instruments to evaluate the robustness of the method with respect to measurement uncertainty. The average performance ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 {$\Delta$}E00 and was well correlated with instrument precision. The optimization approach improved performance by a factor of two compared with direct measurements. Despite differences in instrument design, the chromaticities of each primary following optimization and black-level flare compensation were very similar. This excellent performance was a result of the display's optoelectronic properties well matching the model assumptions. The technique was also used to characterize three additional LCD displays ranging in their matching of the model assumptions. In this case, performance worsened. For one display, more complex models would be required for colorimetric characterization. Finally, a colorimetric characterization based on measurements at the center of the display and perpendicular to the face was used to predict measurements at the edges and at different angles. The results indicated that characterizations would be required at multiple positions and angles in order to achieve sufficient accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Collectively the daily, seasonal, lunar and tidal geophysical cycles regulate much of the temporal biology of life on Earth. The increasing isolation of human societies from these geophysical cycles, as a result of improved living conditions, high-quality nutrition and 24/7 working practices, have led many to believe that human biology functions independently of them. Yet recent studies have highlighted the dominant role that our circadian clock plays in the organisation of 24 hour patterns of behaviour and physiology. Preferred wake and sleep times are to a large extent driven by an endogenous temporal program that uses sunlight as an entraining cue. The alarm clock can drive human activity rhythms but has little direct effect on our endogenous 24 hour physiology. In many situations, our biology and our society appear to be in serious opposition, and the damaging consequences to our health under these circumstances are increasingly recognised. The seasons dominate the lives of non-equatorial species, and until recently, they also had a marked influence on much of human biology. Despite human isolation from seasonal changes in temperature, food and photoperiod in the industrialised nations, the seasons still appear to have a small, but significant, impact upon when individuals are born and many aspects of health. The seasonal changes that modulate our biology, and how these factors might interact with the social and metabolic status of the individual to drive seasonal effects, are still poorly understood. Lunar cycles had, and continue to have, an influence upon human culture, though despite a persistent belief that our mental health and other behaviours are modulated by the phase of the moon, there is no solid evidence that human biology is in any way regulated by the lunar cycle.},

  abstract = {The paper considers the problem of illuminant estimation: how, given an image of a scene, recorded under an unknown light, we can recover an estimate of that light. Obtaining such an estimate is a central part of solving the color constancy problem. Thus, the work presented will have applications in fields such as color-based object recognition and digital photography. Rather than attempting to recover a single estimate of the illuminant, we instead set out to recover a measure of the likelihood that each of a set of possible illuminants was the scene illuminant. We begin by determining which image colors can occur (and how these colors are distributed) under each of a set of possible lights. We discuss how, for a given camera, we can obtain this knowledge. We then correlate this information with the colors in a particular image to obtain a measure of the likelihood that each of the possible lights was the scene illuminant. Finally, we use this likelihood information to choose a single light as an estimate of the scene illuminant. Computation is expressed and performed in a generic correlation framework which we develop. We propose a new probabilistic instantiation of this correlation framework and show that it delivers very good color constancy on both synthetic and real images. We further show that the proposed framework is rich enough to allow many existing algorithms to be expressed within it: the gray-world and gamut-mapping algorithms are presented in this framework and we also explore the relationship of these algorithms to other probabilistic and neural network approaches to color constancy},

  abstract = {Computational color constancy is the task of estimating the true reflectances of visible surfaces in an image. In this paper we follow a line of research that assumes uniform illumination of a scene, and that the principal step in estimating reflectances is the estimation of the scene illuminant. We review recent approaches to illuminant estimation, firstly those based on formulae for normalisation of the reflectance distribution in an image - so-called grey-world algorithms, and those based on a Bayesian formulation of image formation. In evaluating these previous approaches we introduce a new tool in the form of a database of 568 high-quality, indoor and outdoor images, accurately labelled with illuminant, and preserved in their raw form, free of correction or normalisation. This has enabled us to establish several properties experimentally. Firstly automatic selection of grey-world algorithms according to image properties is not nearly so effective as has been thought. Secondly, it is shown that Bayesian illuminant estimation is significantly improved by the improved accuracy of priors for illuminant and reflectance that are obtained from the new dataset.},

  issn = {0042-6989},
  abstract = {Most models of color vision assume that signals from the three classes of cone receptor are recoded into only three independent post-receptoral channels: one that encodes luminance and two that encode color. Stimuli that are equated for their effects on two of the channels should be discriminable only to the remaining channel, and are thus assumed to isolate the responses of single channels. We used an asymmetric matching task to examine whether such models can account for changes in color appearance following adaptation to contrast\textemdash{}to temporal variations in luminance and chromaticity around a fixed mean luminance and chromaticity. The experiments extend to suprathreshold color appearance the threshold adaptation paradigm of Krauskopf, Williams and Heeley [(1982) Vision Research, 32, 1123\textendash{}1131]. Adaptation changes the perceived color of chromatic test stimuli both by reducing their saturation (contrast) and by changing their hue (direction within the equiluminant plane). The saturation losses are largest for test stimuli that lie along the chromatic axis defining the adapting modulation, while the hue changes are rotations away from the adapting direction and toward an orthogonal direction within the S and L \textemdash{} M plane. Similar selective changes in both perceived color and perceived lightness occur following adaptation to stimuli that covary in luminance and chromaticity. The selectivity of the aftereffects for multiple directions within color-luminance space is inconsistent with sensitivity changes in only three independent channels. These aftereffects suggest instead that color appearance depends on channels that can be selectively tuned to any color-luminance direction, and that there are no directions that invariably isolate responses in only a single channel. We use the perceived color changes to examine the spectral sensitivities of the chromatic channels and to estimate the distribution of channels. We also examine how adaptation alters the contrast-response function, how it affects reaction times for luminance and chromatic contrast, the extent to which the aftereffects exhibit interocular transfer, and the way in which the perceived color changes differ from those induced by conventional light adaptation.},

One solution is to code the same information in many parallel channels, but a second possibility is to use the individual nerve cells as efficiently as possible by coding information in ways that minimise their faults. A first step towards efficiency is the elimination of redundancy from the incoming data [2,3,4,5,6] and a second is to code the essential messages in ways that fully exploit neuronal signalling capacity [5]; a procedure that often reduces the redundancy in a nerve cell's response.},

  abstract = {The ranges of stimuli that are perceived as white were investigated in a dark surround. Stimulus light was supplied by three gas-filled tungsten lamps modified with three glass filters and an opal glass. Chromaticity and luminance were changed by adjusting distances between the opal glass and each of the lamps. We employed the method of minimal changes and the constant-stimulus method. In the former case, the luminances of two of the stimulus components were kept fixed, while the observer was allowed to change the luminance of the other component. Ranges of chromaticities reported as white with a probability of 0.5 or more by three observers were located along straight lines near the blackbody locus, at color temperatures higher than 5500 K. With the constant-stimulus method, 45 observers judged 18 stimuli located at different positions in the neighborhood of CIE standard source C in the chromaticity diagram, all of which had luminances equal to 20 asb. The result was that an oval range of points reported as white with a 0.5 probability was obtained around CIE standard source C.},

After more than 20 years of use, close-range photogrammetry, now for the most part entirely digital, has become an accepted, powerful and readily available technique for engineers, scientists and others who wish to utilise images to make accurate 3D measurements of complex objects. Here they will find the photogrammetric fundamentals, details of system hardware and software, and broad range of real-world applications in order to achieve this. Following the introduction, the book provides fundamental mathematics covering subjects such as image orientation, digital imaging processing and 3D reconstruction methods, as well as a discussion of imaging technology, including targeting and illumination, and its implementation in hardware and software. It concludes with an overview of photogrammetric solutions for typical applications in engineering, manufacturing, medical science, architecture, archaeology and other fields.},

The core elements are presented in a schematic representation. The overview can be used to find answers on basic questions about the practice of citing documents.

  abstract = {Perceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input, but also on the behavioral context. An important contextual factor is the history of one's own choices. Neural activity in brain regions involved in decision formation exhibits traces of previous choices. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. Models of perceptual choice construe decision formation as the accumulation of sensory evidence towards decision bounds. In this framework, it is commonly assumed that choice history signals shift the starting point of accumulation towards the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit a bounded accumulation ('drift diffusion') decision model to behavioral data from multiple perceptual choice tasks and sensory modalities, and estimated bias terms that dependent on observers' previous choices. Individual history biases in behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to affect the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention towards (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.},

However, other effects caused by illumination pose and specularity on three-dimensional object surfaces have not received notable attention.

It utilizes a chromaticity space based on log-ratio of sensor responses for illumination pose and color invariance.

  abstract = {We present a color-constancy algorithm that uses quantum-catch data from reflected lights to recover surface reflectance functions and illuminant spectral power distributions. The algorithm recovers both surface and light-source spectral properties simultaneously. The method works in all situations that were handled by the earlier two-stage algorithms of Maloney and Wandell [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A3, 29 ( 1986)] and D'Zmura and Iverson [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A9, 490 ( 1992); J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 2148, 2166 ( 1993); J. Opt. Soc. Am. A11, 1970 ( 1994)]. In addition, the method handles problems that lie outside the scope of earlier algorithms. Using this method, a trichromatic visual system can recover, when provided adequate information, spectral descriptions of arbitrarily high accuracy for lights and surfaces. We determine conditions under which bilinear models can be used to recover color properties uniquely with the new procedure, and we formulate an algorithm for checking whether a particular bilinear model provides perfect color constancy. This research extends our analysis of linear methods for color constancy begun earlier [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 2148, 2166 ( 1993)].},

Critics sometimes insufficiently appreciate the following: (a) Generality requires such abstraction. (b) Perceptual principles are not themselves given in sensory input. (c) Principles of learning are not themselves learned. (d) Though all such principles are somehow instantiated in the brain, their ultimate, nonarbitrary source must be sought in the regularities of the world \textendash{} including those reflecting abstract mathematical principles (e.g., of group theory and symmetry).

  abstract = {Statistical regularities of the environment are important for learning, memory, intelligence, inductive inference, and in fact, for any area of cognitive science where an information-processing brain promotes survival by exploiting them. This has been recognised by many of those interested in cognitive function, starting with Helmholtz, Mach, and Pearson, and continuing through Craik, Tolman, Attneave, and Brunswik. In the current era, many of us have begun to show how neural mechanisms exploit the regular statistical properties of natural images. Shepard proposed that the apparent trajectory of an object when seen successively at two positions results from internalising the rules of kinematic geometry, and although kinematic geometry is not statistical in nature, this is clearly a related idea. Here it is argued that Shepard's term, ``internalisation,'' is insufficient because it is also necessary to derive an advantage from the process. Having mechanisms selectively sensitive to the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation commonly experienced when viewing moving objects would facilitate the detection, interpolation, and extrapolation of such motions, and might explain the twisting motions that are experienced. Although Shepard's explanation in terms of Chasles' rule seems doubtful, his theory and experiments illustrate that local twisting motions are needed for the analysis of moving objects and provoke thoughts about how they might be detected.},

  volume = {24},
  issn = {1469-1825, 0140-525X},
  abstract = {The notion of internalization put forth by Roger Shepard continues to be appealing and challenging. He suggests that we have internalized, during our evolutionary development, environmental regularities, or constraints. Internalization solves one of the hardest problems of perceptual psychology: the underspecification problem. That is the problem of how well-defined perceptual experience is generated from the often ambiguous and incomplete sensory stimulation. Yet, the notion of internalization creates new problems that may outweigh the solution of the underspecification problem. To support this claim, I first examine the concept of internalization, breaking it down into several distinct interpretations. These range from well-resolved dynamic regularities to ill-resolved statistical regularities. As a function of the interpretation the researcher selects, an empirical test of the internalization hypothesis may be straightforward or it may become virtually impossible. I then attempt to cover the range of interpretations by drawing on examples from different domains of visual event perception. Unfortunately, the experimental tests regarding most candidate regularities, such as gravitational acceleration, fail to support the concept of internalization. This suggests that narrow interpretations of the concept should be given up in favor of more abstract interpretations. However, the latter are not easily amenable to empirical testing. There is nonetheless a way to test these abstract interpretations by contrasting internalization with the opposite concept: externalization of body dynamics. I summarize evidence for such a projection of body constraints onto external objects. Based on the combined evidence of well-resolved and ill- resolved regularities, the value of the notion of internalization has to be reassessed.},

According to him, this internal knowledge is the legacy of a process of internalization; a process of natural selection over the evolutionary history of the species. Shepard has developed his proposal most fully in his analysis of the relation between kinematic geometry and the shape of the motion path in apparent motion displays. We argue that Shepard has made a case for applying the principles of kinematic geometry to the perception of motion, but that he has not made the case for injecting these principles into the mind of the percipient. We offer a more modest interpretation of his important findings: that kinematic geometry may be a model of apparent motion. Inasmuch as our recommended interpretation does not lodge geometry in the mind of the percipient, the motivation of positing internalization, a process that moves kinematic geometry into the mind, is obviated. In our conclusion, we suggest that cognitive psychologists, in their embrace of internal mental universals and internalization may have been seduced by the siren call of metaphor.},

First, I explore the analogy Shepard draws between internalized circadian rhythms and the supposed internalization of kinematic geometry. Next, questions are raised about how to interpret and justify applying results from his own and others' experimental studies of apparent motion to more everyday cases of motion perception in richer environments. Finally, some difficulties with Shepard's account of the evolutionary development of his kinematic constraint are considered.},

  abstract = {Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

  title = {A Possible Evolutionary Basis for Trichromacy},
  volume = {1250},
  abstract = {For normal human observers, color is three-dimensional. The color appearance of any surface can be matched by adjusting just three variables (such as lightness, hue, and saturation). This trichromacy is mediated, but not ultimately explained, by the existence of three classes of photoreceptors -- retinal cones having peak sensitivities to longer, medium, and shorter wavelengths of visible light. Possibly, this trichromacy is the result of a more or less arbitrary compromise between (a) the larger number of dimensions required to represent the full spectral reflectance distributions of surfaces and (b) the smaller number of classes of retinal receptors needed to maintain, through denser retinal packing, higher spatial resolution for each receptor class. Alternatively, building on a linear model for color vision, as formulated by Maloney and Wandell, this paper seeks a less arbitrary basis for trichromacy in the prevailing degrees of freedom of terrestrial illumination. Natural selection may have favored trichromacy because it permits the achievement of color constancy despite terrestrial transformations of sunlight, which, unlike the variations in surface reflectances, have been limited to essentially three degrees of freedom. Any visual system, whether biological or artificial (including a system that requires merely an achromatic, shades-of-gray representation), can achieve constancy of color (and of lightness) only by first analyzing its optical input into three chromatic channels in order to compensate for the prevailing three degrees of freedom of terrestrial illumination.},

All three components were identified and their proportions analyzed in each extract. The red-sensitive pigments are not thought to be artifacts or additional rod pigments. Their occurrence in extracts of light-adapted, cone-rich retinae suggests that they are cone pigments. This is supported by the Coryphaena data: the proportion of red-sensitive pigment was greater (1) in light-adapted retinae and (2) in extracts prepared from portions of the retina containing the most cones.},

The angular distribution of underwater light was determined by restricting the collection angle of the light receptor. The total intensity and the spectrum of these radiance measurements are interrelated. The radiance spectrum of downwelling light is broad, while that of horizontal light is less intense, narrower and shifted to the blue. The radiance spectrum of upwelling light depends on total depth and the proximity of a reflective substrate. Measured far from the bottom, it is narrow and blue, but broadens as the receptor approaches the substrate.},

  shorttitle = {Part {{III}}},
  abstract = {The feeding strategies of diurnal, tropical marine fishes correlate with the visual pigments extracted from their retinae and with the photic environments in which they hunt prey. Two basic feeding modes prevail: (1) silhouetting prey from below against the surface background light; and (2) contrasting prey against other fields of view, which are more monochromatic. Fishes that silhouette prey from below possess a single visual pigment matched to the spectral distribution of downwelling light. This maximizes the contrast between the brighter background and darker target. To predators that view prey in the horizontal fleld, their targets may appear either darker or brighter than the background. The photocontrast of a nonreflective target is maximized by a class of cones with a matching visual pigment. But the contrast of reflective (``bright'') targets is enhanced by visual pigments offset from the spectral distribution of the monochromatic blue background. Thus, the evolutionary selection of multiple photopic systems, and of color vision itself, is probably related to the maximization of visual contrast against monochromatic backgrounds.},

Here we explore this idea using asymmetric color matching. We find that von Kries adaptation holds, regardless of whether chromatic constancy index is low or high. When illumination changes the stimulus luminance (reflectance), lightness constancy is weak and matching is dictated by object/background luminance contrast. When this contrast is masked or disrupted, lightness constancy mechanisms are more prominent. Thus von Kries adaptation is incompatible with lightness constancy, suggesting that cortical mechanisms must underlie color constancy, as expected from neurophysiological studies [Zeki, Nature 284, 412 (1980); Wild, Nature 313, 133 (1985)].},

Methods are given also for the calculation of the spectral irradiation curve for any elevation above sea level and for any air mass, and these methods lead to proposed standard curves to be used in engineering calculations dealing with direct sunlight at sea level. These curves are checked against independent data on total irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, illumination, and color temperature. In all cases, the agreement between calculated and experimental results gives confidence in the validity of the proposed curves for various engineering applications.},

  title = {Optimising {{Light Source Spectrum}} to {{Reduce}} the {{Energy Absorbed}} by {{Objects}}},
  abstract = {Light is used to illuminate objects in the built environment. Humans can only observe light reflected from an object. Light absorbed by an object turns into heat and does not contribute to visibility. Since the spectral output of the new lighting technologies can be tuned, it is possible to imagine a lighting system that detects the colours of objects and emits customised light to minimise the absorbed energy. Previous optimisation studies investigated the use of narrowband LEDs to maximise the efficiency and colour quality of a light source. While these studies aimed to tune a white light source for general use, the lighting system proposed here minimises the energy consumed by lighting by detecting colours of objects and emitting customised light onto each coloured part of the object. This thesis investigates the feasibility of absorption-minimising light source spectra and their impact on the colour appearance of objects and energy consumption.  
Two computational studies were undertaken to form the theoretical basis of the absorption-minimising light source spectra. Computational simulations show that the theoretical single-peak spectra can lower the energy consumption up to around 38 \% to 62 \%, and double-peak test spectra can result in energy savings up to 71 \%, without causing colour shifts. In these studies, standard reference illuminants, theoretical test spectra and coloured test samples were used. These studies are followed by the empirical evidence collected from two psychophysical experiments. Data from the experiments show that observers find the colour appearance of objects equally natural and attractive under spectrally optimised spectra and reference white light sources. An increased colour difference, to a certain extent, is found acceptable, which allows even higher energy savings. However, the translucent nature of some objects may negatively affect the results.},

  abstract = {John Lythgoe was one of the pioneers of the 'Ecology of Vision', a subject that he ably delineated in his classic and inspirational book published some 20 years ago [1]. At heart, the original book aimed generally to identify inter-relationships between vision, animal behaviour and the environment. John Lythgoe excelled at identifying the interesting 'questions' in the ecology of an animal that fitted the 'answers' presented by an analysis of the visual system. Over the last twenty years, however, since Lythgoe's landmark publication, much progress has been made and the field has broadened considerably. In particular, our understanding of the 'adaptive mechanisms' underlying the ecology of vision has reached considerable depths, extending to the molecular dimension, partly as a result of development and application of new techniques. This complements the advances made in parallel in clinically oriented vision research [2]. The current book endeavours to review the progress made in the ecology of vision field by bringing together many of the major researchers presently active in the expanded subject area. The contents deal with theoretical and physical considerations of light and photoreception, present examples of visual system structure and function, and delve into aspects of visual behaviour and communi cation. Throughout the book, we have tried to emphasise one of the major themes to emerge within the ecology of vision: the high degree of adaptability that visual mechanisms are capable of undergoing in response to diverse, and dynamic, environments and behaviours.},

  abstract = {Absorbance spectra were recorded by microspectrophotometry
from 39 different rod and cone types representing amphibians,
reptiles, and fishes, with A1- or A2-based visual pigments
and {$\lambda$}max ranging from 357 to 620 nm. The
purpose was to investigate accuracy limits of putative
universal templates for visual pigment absorbance spectra,
and if possible to amend the templates to overcome the
limitations. It was found that (1) the absorbance spectrum
of frog rhodopsin extract very precisely parallels that
of rod outer segments from the same individual, with only
a slight hypsochromic shift in {$\lambda$}max, hence
templates based on extracts are valid for absorbance in
situ; (2) a template based on the bovine rhodopsin
extract data of Partridge and De Grip (1991) describes
the absorbance of amphibian rod outer segments excellently,
contrary to recent electrophysiological results; (3) the
{$\lambda$}max/{$\lambda$} invariance of spectral shape
fails for A1 pigments with small {$\lambda$}max and
for A2 pigments with large {$\lambda$}max, but the
deviations are systematic and can be readily incorporated
into, for example, the Lamb (1995) template. We thus propose
modified templates for the main ``{$\alpha$}-band''
of A1 and A2 pigments and show that these describe both
absorbance and spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors
over the whole range of {$\lambda$}max. Subtraction
of the {$\alpha$}-band from the full absorbance spectrum leaves
a ``{$\beta$}-band'' described by a {$\lambda$}max-dependent
Gaussian. We conclude that the idea of universal templates
(one for A1- and one for A2-based visual pigments) remains
valid and useful at the present level of accuracy of data
on photoreceptor absorbance and sensitivity. The sum of
our expressions for the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-band gives a good
description for visual pigment spectra with {$\lambda$}max
{$>$} 350 nm.},

  abstract = {The endemic cottoid fish of Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia offer a singular opportunity for examining within a number of closely related species, the relationships of visual pigments, photoreceptor complements and depth within a deep freshwater environment. The lake, the deepest (1600 m) and one of the largest and most ancient in the world, is unique in that the oxygen levels at the bottom are only reduced to about 80\% of the surface levels. We have studied, by light microscopy, microspectrophotometry and visual pigment extraction, the retinas from 17 species of Baikal cottoids that live at different depths within the lake. Generally the retinas contain, in addition to rods, large green-sensitive double cones and small blue-sensitive single cones: surprisingly for freshwater fish, the visual pigments are based on Vitamin A1 The {$\lambda$}max of both rods and cones are displaced to shorter wavelengths with increasing depth. Surface species have cones with {$\lambda$}max at about 546,525 and 450 nm and rods at 523 nm, deeper living species retain cones, but with {$\lambda$}max shifting towards 500 and 425 nm and with rods at 480 nm, whereas the deepest living fish possess only rods ({$\lambda$}max, 480\textendash{}500 nm). These data clearly show a correlation between photoreceptor complement, visual pigment {$\lambda$}max, and depth, but question the hypothesis that there is a correlation of pigment ({$\lambda$}max with water colour since, in contrast to oceanic waters, the maximum transmission of Baikal water is between 550 and 600 nm.},

Thus, the sensitivity of the eye to light of different wavelengths over the spectrum has been accurately estimated for the initial photoreceptor stage which converts light incident on the retina into neural signals. Spectral sensitivities have also been obtained, in part at least, for the subsequent post-receptoral neural pathways that apparently recode colour information into separate signals specifying luminance and chromaticity. These and other findings on receptoral and post-receptoral spectral sensitivities are considered in relation to techniques for functionally isolating colour-processing pathways in the human visual system. Also discussed briefly are models of colour vision, the relationship between form perception and colour vision, and inherited and acquired colour-vision deficiencies.},

  abstract = {The visual pigments in the rods do not have a spectral absorption that gives them maximalsensitivity. The visual pigments of ``deep sea'' fish are an exception for these do match the environmental light to give maximum sensitivity. At the low light intensities at which the rods operate, it is the number of photons that go to make upeach element of the image that limits the ability of the eye to discriminate detail and contrast. Chemically induced isomerisation of the visual pigment molecule may cause spurious visual signals that limit the ability of the eye to detect contrasts in very dim light. In bright light the spurious visual signals become insignificant in number compared to the true photon-induced visual signals. Compared to the rods, cone visual pigments do match the spectral properties of the environment exceptthat there appear to be no visual pigments with an absorption maximum beyond the 625 nm porphyropsins in cones. U.V. absorbing pigments are know in invertebrates, birds and fish that live in very shallow water. Animals have photoreceptors in parts of the body other than the eyes. In vertebrates these sites includethe pineal, chromatophores, brain, skin and harderian gland. There is evidence based on immunocytochemistry and action spectra that at least some of the skin and pineal receptors contain visual pigments, but like those of the rods, these do not match the spectral quality of the environmental light.},

  abstract = {An interesting optical focusing effect occurred in the early heating phases of a simple model of a lava lamp that was constructed to demonstrate convection effects. During this early heating phase, the interface between the two immiscible liquids was found to form a surface of rotation with a conic cross section that acted as a mirror to produce an excellent image of the filament of the bulb within the lower liquid. The relevant features of the lamp construction are discussed briefly, and photographs of this focusing effect are shown. A simple analysis is presented that transforms the photographed cross section of the liquid interface into the true cross section by removing the effect of the cylindrical lens formed by the fluid-filled bottle, and the resulting cross section is then fitted to the shape of an ellipse. The possible cause for the shape of this liquid interface is discussed and compared and contrasted with the somewhat analogous situation of a stretched circular membrane that is subjected to different gas pressures on either side of the membrane.},

  abstract = {Visual ecology is the study of how animals use visual systems to meet their ecological needs, how these systems have evolved, and how they are specialized for particular visual tasks. \emph{Visual Ecology} provides the first up-to-date synthesis of the field to appear in more than three decades. Featuring some 225 illustrations, including more than 140 in color, spread throughout the text, this comprehensive and accessible book begins by discussing the basic properties of light and the optical environment. It then looks at how photoreceptors intercept light and convert it to usable biological signals, how the pigments and cells of vision vary among animals, and how the properties of these components affect a given receptor's sensitivity to light. The book goes on to examine how eyes and photoreceptors become specialized for an array of visual tasks, such as navigation, evading prey, mate choice, and communication.
A timely and much-needed resource for students and researchers alike, \emph{Visual Ecology} also includes a glossary and a wealth of examples drawn from the full diversity of visual systems.

  abstract = {The surface properties of an object, such as texture, glossiness or colour, provide important cues to its identity. However, the actual visual stimulus received by the eye is determined by both the properties of the object and the illumination. We tested whether operational colour constancy for glossy objects (the ability to distinguish changes in spectral reflectance of the object, from changes in the spectrum of the illumination) was affected by rotational motion of either the object or the light source. The different chromatic and geometric properties of the specular and diffuse reflections provide the basis for this discrimination, and we systematically varied specularity to control the available information. Observers viewed animations of isolated objects undergoing either lighting or surface-based spectral transformations accompanied by motion. By varying the axis of rotation, and surface patterning or geometry, we manipulated: (i) motion-related information about the scene, (ii) relative motion between the surface patterning and the specular reflection of the lighting, and (iii) image disruption caused by this motion. Despite large individual differences in performance with static stimuli, motion manipulations neither improved nor degraded performance. As motion significantly disrupts frame-by-frame low-level image statistics, we infer that operational constancy depends on a high-level scene interpretation, which is maintained in all conditions.},

  abstract = {Much of what we know about how our sensory systems operate comes from studying aftereffects. Prolonged and repeated exposure to a constant stimulus (adaptation) can impact responses to subsequent test stimuli, compared to a non-adapted test stimulus. Researchers often infer, based on changes to response patterns, that sensory encoding has been changed by adaptation. However, it can be ambiguous whether a given aftereffect changes sensory encoding, decision processes, or both. We propose that confidence estimates can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify whether aftereffects arise either partially or entirely from post-perceptual processes. In three experiments, we demonstrate the utility of confidence judgements in determining whether an aftereffect results from sensory or criterion changes. Given the simplicity of our approach, this tool could readily be applied to resolve contemporary controversies regarding the origins of aftereffects and the penetration of perception by cognition.},

We illustrate why and how the Color Vector Graphic and Local Chroma Shift values capture information about color rendition that is impossible to describe with average measures (such as CIE Ra, IES Rf, or IES Rg) but that is pertinent to more completely quantifying color rendition and to understanding human evaluations of color quality in the built environment. We also present alternatives for quantifying the Color Vector Graphic and Local Chroma Shift values, which can inform the development of future measures.},

  abstract = {It is possible to assess the damage to artworks by measuring different physical and chemical parameters. One of the most important parameters is colour difference, which is a consequence of chemical changes in the material. CIE 157:2004 `Control of Damage to Museum Objects by Optical Radiation' classifies museum collections into four groups, according to different levels of light fastness. However, these classes were developed from research using traditional light sources. Even though LED technology is becoming more popular, there is no advanced evaluation of colour fading or a colour change test for contemporary artworks. This study established that the CIE 157:2004 method, based on threshold effective radiant exposure, can be applied to an actual ageing test of ultraviolet-blocked light sources including two types of white LEDs and one traditional halogen lamp. The results also present a colour fading model that can be used in museum LED lighting to predict the colour difference in contemporary photographic materials for short- and long-term exhibition. This study also provides a revised light dosage classification of modern photographic materials for museums. Moreover, the verification studies can be used as a conceptual reference for assessing the damage potential of other art materials under the tunable multi-LED system of the future.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24 h cycles that persist in the absence of external time cues. These rhythms provide an internal representation of day length and optimize physiology and behaviour to the varying demands of the solar cycle. These clocks require daily adjustment to local time and the primary time cue (zeitgeber) used by most vertebrates is the daily change in the amount of environmental light (irradiance) at dawn and dusk, a process termed photoentrainment. Attempts to understand the photoreceptor mechanisms mediating non-image-forming responses to light, such as photoentrainment, have resulted in the discovery of a remarkable array of different photoreceptors and photopigment families, all of which appear to use a basic opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment biochemistry. In non-mammalian vertebrates, specialized photoreceptors are located within the pineal complex, deep brain and dermal melanophores. There is also strong evidence in fish and amphibians for the direct photic regulation of circadian clocks in multiple tissues. By contrast, mammals possess only ocular photoreceptors. However, in addition to the image-forming rods and cones of the retina, there exists a third photoreceptor system based on a subset of melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). In this review, we discuss the range of vertebrate photoreceptors and their opsin photopigments, describe the melanopsin/pRGC system in some detail and then finally consider the molecular evolution and sensory ecology of these non-image-forming photoreceptor systems.},

Correlated color temperature can be calculated using the new diagram, leading to somewhat different results than those calculated according to the CIE 1960 uv diagram.

The paper showcases diverse measures available to valorise energy consumption and visual aspects. A series of energy and visual criteria were selected, defining acceptance thresholds for dynamic evaluations. Whole-building computer simulations were performed on a standardized office located in a temperate climate. Discrete window-to-wall ratio variations were studied to demonstrate how these criteria affect the solution space. Results were classified using a graphical optimization method, obtaining a solution space satisfying both energy and visual requirements. Most project expectations can be met within the range of sizes. However, unprotected windows barely meet acceptance criteria, needing additional control devices. Applying various related criteria with adequate values increases the diversity of acceptable solutions but too many limits it. Clear objectives and acceptance ranges have to be conceptualized in order to translate them into decisions. This becomes important when involving team design.},

  abstract = {Energy conservation in building arena is essential issue for achieving sustainable environment. However, buildings experienced significant amount of heat gain or loss through window and this will affect the thermal comfort of buildings׳ occupants. Building without window is able to save energy, but it is not recommended due to the benefits of natural light on visual comfort and the biological effect of natural light on humans. Hence, window design plays important role in building architect. One of the essential parts of window is the glazing. Selecting a window glazing is complicated when energy saving and daylighting aspects of a building are considered concurrently. Optimization techniques offer a balance solution for the contradictions in selecting a window glazing of energy-efficient building. This paper intended to reveal the impacts of window glazing on the energy and daylighting performances of building through the previous researches. Then, the optimization techniques used by various researchers in choosing a glazing are highlighted. The emerging glazing technologies were discussed as well.},

  shorttitle = {The Early Design Stage of a Building Envelope},
  abstract = {The majority of decisions in the building design process are taken in the early design stage. This delicate phase presents the greatest opportunity to obtain high performance buildings, but pertinent performance information is needed for designers to be able to deal with multidisciplinary and contrasting objectives. In the present work, an integrative approach for the early stages of building design is proposed to obtain detailed information on energy efficient envelope configurations. By means of genetic algorithms, a multi-objective search was performed with the aim of minimising the energy need for heating, cooling and lighting of a case study. The investigation was carried out for an open space office building by varying number, position, shape and type of windows and the thickness of the masonry walls. The search was performed through an implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, which was made capable of exchanging information with the EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The analyses were conducted both in absence and in presence of an urban context in the climates of Palermo, Torino, Frankfurt and Oslo. In addition, a preliminary analysis on the Pareto front solutions was performed to investigate the statistical variation of the values assumed by the input variables in all the non-dominated solutions. For the analysed case study, results highlighted a small overall Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of the building in all locations. Pareto front solutions were characterised by low WWR values especially in east, west and north exposed fa{\c c}ades. The area of the south facing windows was higher compared to the other orientations and characterised by a higher variability.},

In the present work a series of visual colour rendering investigations are described and their correlation with the current method of calculating colour rendering index as well as with possible updates of the calculation method is evaluated. Visual experiments have shown that the CIE Test Method is not a good predictor of visual perception. A method based on calculating colour differences using the CIECAM02 colour appearance model provides better correlation between visual and calculated colour rendering values.},

Nonetheless, your perception of the world is perspectival. The coin looks different when slanted than when head-on, and there is some respect in which the slanted coin looks similar to a head-on ellipse. Many hold that perception is perspectival because you perceive certain properties that correspond to the ``looks'' of things. I argue that this view is misguided. I consider the two standard versions of this view. What I call the PLURALIST APPROACH fails to give a unified account of the perspectival character of perception, while what I call the PERSPECTIVAL PROPERTIES APPROACH violates central commitments of contemporary psychology. I propose instead that perception is perspectival because of the way perceptual states are structured from their parts.},

  abstract = {The time course of recovery from chromatic adaptation in human vision was tracked by determining the wavelength of light that appears uniquely yellow (neither red nor green) both before and after exposure to yellowish green and yellowish red adapting lights. Recovery is complete within 5 min after steady light exposure. After exposure to the alternating repeated sequence 10-sec light/10-sec dark, the initial magnitude of the aftereffect is reduced but recovery is retarded. The results are interpreted in terms of two processes located at different levels in the hierarchical organization of the visual system. One is a change in the balance of cone receptor sensitivities; the second is a shift in the equilibrium baseline between opposite-signed responses of the red/green channel at the opponent-process neural level. The baseline-shift mechanism is effective in the condition in which repeated input signals originating at the receptors are of sufficient strength to activate the system effectively. Hence, this process is revealed in the alternating adaptation condition when the receptors undergo partial recovery after each light exposure, but receptor adaptation during continued steady light exposure effectively protects the subsequent neural systems from continued strong activation.},

We hypothesize that under the conditions that isolate these branches of the two-color threshold a signal originating with the photon absorptions of the short-wavelength cones passes through two sites of attenuation. The first site's gain is controlled by the short-wavelength cones alone; the second site's gain is determined by a net ``blue/yellow'' opponent signal. The two sites are distinguished by spectral sensitivity, absolute field sensitivity and dynamic properties. The theory, formalized in four equations, provides a good account of these features of the increment thresholds: (1) super-additivity of the effects of{$\Pi$}1-equated long- and short-wavelength fields; (2) upward deviation of the{$\Pi$}1 threshold from the Weber line on bright blue backgrounds; (3) cancellative subadditivity of fields whose mixture is in approximate blue/yellow equilibrium: (4) the ``limited conditioning effect'' of long-wavelength fields; (5) transient ``tritanopia''.},

  volume = {46},
  issn = {0028-3932},
  abstract = {A sudden change in illuminant (e.g., the outcome of turning on a tungsten light in a room illuminated with dim, natural daylight) causes a ``global'' change in perceived colour which subjects often recognise as a change of illuminant. In spite of this distinct, global change in the perceptual appearance of the scene caused by significant changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from different objects under the new illuminant, the perceived colour of the objects remains largely unchanged and this cornerstone property of human vision is often described as instantaneous colour constancy (ICC). ICC mechanisms are often difficult to study. The generation of appropriate stimuli to isolate ICC mechanisms remains a difficult task since the extraction of colour signals is also confounded in the processing of spatial chromatic context that leads to ICC. The extraction of differences in chromaticity that describe spatial changes in the wavelength composition of the light on the retina is a necessary operation that must precede colour constancy computations. A change of illuminant or changes in the spectral reflectance of the elements that make up the scene under a constant illuminant cause spatial changes in chromatic context and are likely to drive colour constancy mechanisms, but not exclusively. The same stimulus changes also cause differences in local luminance contrast and overall light flux changes, stimulus attributes that can activate different areas of the visual cortex. In order to address this problem we carried out a series of dichoptic experiments designed to investigate how the colour signals from the two eyes are combined in dichoptically viewed Mondrians and the extent to which the processing of chromatic context in monocularly driven neurons contributes to ICC. The psychophysical findings show that normal levels of ICC can be achieved in dichoptic experiments, even when the subject remains unaware of any changes of illuminant. Functional MRI (fMRI) experiments using new stimuli that produce stimulation of colour constancy mechanisms only in one condition with little or no difference in the activity generated in colour processing mechanisms in both test and reference conditions were also carried out. The results show that the processing of ICC signals generates strong activation in V1 and the fusiform colour area (V4, V4A). Significant activation was also observed in areas V2 and V3.},

  abstract = {The light reflected from an object depends not only on the surface properties of this object but also on the illuminant. The same is true for the excitations of the photoreceptors, which serve as the basis for the perceived colour. However, our visual system has the ability to perceive constant surface colours despite changes in illumination1. The average chromaticity of the retinal image of a scene depends on the illumination, and thus might be used by the visual system to estimate the illumination and to modulate the correction that subserves colour constancy2,3,4. But this measure is not sufficient: a reddish scene under white light can produce the same mean stimulation as a neutral scene in red light. Higher order scene statistics\textemdash{}for example, the correlation between redness and luminance within the image\textemdash{}allow these cases to be distinguished. Here we report that the human visual system does exploit such a statistic when estimating the illuminant, and gives it a weight that is statistically appropriate for the natural environment.},

  abstract = {We have extended the experiments of McCann et al. by incorporating their Mondrian stimulus into a dynamic color matching (DCM) technique that allows the subject to match accurately the color of any test patch under sequential changes of illuminant. Changes in the perceived color of a central test stimulus as a result of surround illuminant changes are investigated in a number of successful binocular and dichoptic experiments. The contribution made by distant patches to instantaneous color constancy (ICC) is found to be small, with the immediate surround (i.e., {$<$}1.5-deg separation) contributing most of the constancy effect. A modified DCM technique was developed to study ICC in patients with unilateral damage to the primary visual cortex. The results of this part of the study suggest that retinal mechanisms do not contribute to ICC. Experiments carried out in subjects with cerebral achromatopsia reveal the existence of hidden constancy, even when the subjects are unable to see the result of functioning ICC mechanisms. Dichoptic implementation of the DCM technique yields reduced but significant ICC index values with more equal contribution from distant surrounds. Our findings suggest that early stage processing of chromatic information in the primary visual cortex contributes significantly to ICC, with only small contributions from extrastriate areas of the cortex.},

  abstract = {In numerous studies on colour constancy or colour induction subjects have to adjust a test field so that it looks achromatic. Their viewing behaviour during these settings is often not controlled or reported. Here I show that the results of grey settings depend on whether subjects visually explore the stimulus by looking around or fixate their gaze exclusively on the test field. Two different viewing instructions are compared with regard to the degree of constancy as measured by the shift of grey settings in coloured surrounds. In variegated surrounds (but not in uniform surrounds) there is a robust effect of viewing condition for all subjects and all surround chromaticities tested, in that exploration increases colour constancy compared to fixating the test field. Values of a colour constancy index are increased by as much as 20\% (where 100\% colour constancy means that the subject chooses as grey the mean chromaticity of the surround) with an average across all subjects and surrounds of 12.6\%. Thus, if this factor is not experimentally controlled, it could inflate variance, reduce comparability between different studies, and even lead to unwarranted conclusions if viewing behaviour unpredictably differs between experimental conditions.},

The eye unconsciously exercises a selective process among the constituent features of a view and thus gives an impressions of enjoyment. Thus, for example, the apparent enlargement of the setting sun is due to a reduction of the field of vision, and the dwarfing of mountainous scenery upon near approach is related to an unconscious enlargement of the field.},

There is no unique solution to this problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both achromatic (luminance) and colour vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among `long-wavelength' receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500 nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments can be incorporated into theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision\textemdash{}involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors\textemdash{}is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages.},

Beginning with an overview of the atmosphere and its components, it introduces the physics that drive weather systems before setting those principles in the context of specific systems of differing scales and latitudes. Finally, the text draws this information together in relation to the problem of anthropogenic climate change. Fundamentals of Weather and Climate is enhanced by extensive pedagogical features including end-of-chapter questions, key points, and custom-drawn illustrations that enable students to more easily visualize the processes and interactions described. A Companion Website offers resources for students and instructors.

  issn = {2296-701X},
  abstract = {Primate color vision is based on two to three cone types in the retina, each expressing a different class of visual pigment, making them the only mammals that possess trichromacy. These pigment classes are the short wavelength-sensitive (SWS1) pigment and the long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) pigment, orthologues of the same pigments found in many other vertebrates, as well as the middle wavelength-sensitive (MWS) pigment, a paralogue to the LWS pigment. Trichromacy was achieved differently in Old World and New World primates. In Old World primates, a duplication of the LWS opsin gene occurred giving rise to a ``red-sensitive'' or L pigment and a ``green-sensitive'' or M pigment. Their corresponding L and M genes are adjacent on the X chromosome which, together with their high sequence homology, is the underlying cause for the high frequency of red-green color blindness seen in humans. In New World primates and prosimians, however, the mechanism leading to trichromacy, with one exception, is based on a single polymorphic LWS gene, from which different allelic variants encode pigments with differing spectral peaks. X chromosome inactivation limits expression to just one gene per photoreceptor meaning that trichromacy is only seen in females; while all male are red-green color blind. Despite several leading hypothesis, the reasons for the different evolutionary paths taken by Old and New World primates for trichromacy are still unclear and remain to be confirmed.},

The current article examines the trends displayed in those studies considered to provide credible evidence: these do not support Kruithof. For pleasant conditions, these data suggest only avoiding low illuminances and do not favor any CCT.},

  abstract = {The primary circadian pacemaker, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain, is photoentrained by light signals from the eyes through the retinohypothalamic tract. Retinal rod and cone cells are not required for photoentrainment. Recent evidence suggests that the entraining photoreceptors are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN. The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs. In mice heterozygous for tau-lacZ targeted to the melanopsin gene locus, {$\beta$}-galactosidase\textendash{}positive RGC axons projected to the SCN and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment or the pupillary light reflex. Rat RGCs that exhibited intrinsic photosensitivity invariably expressed melanopsin. Hence, melanopsin is most likely the visual pigment of phototransducing RGCs that set the circadian clock and initiate other non\textendash{}image-forming visual functions.},

  abstract = {Lighting constitutes more than 20\% of total U.S. electricity consumption, a similar fraction in the European Union, and an even higher fraction in many developing countries. Because many current lighting technologies are highly inefficient, improved technologies for lighting hold great potential for energy savings and for reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions. Solid-state lighting shows great promise as a source of efficient, affordable, color-balanced white light. Indeed, assuming market discount rates, engineering-economic analysis demonstrates that white solidstate lighting already has a lower levelized annual cost (LAC) than incandescent bulbs. The LAC for white solid-state lighting will be lower than that of the most efficient fluorescent bulbs by the end of this decade. However, a large literature indicates that households do not make their decisions in terms of simple expected economic value. After a review of the technology, we compare the electricity consumption, carbon emissions, and cost-effectiveness of current lighting technologies, accounting for expected performance evolution through 2015. We then simulate the lighting electricity consumption and implicit greenhouse gases emissions for the U.S. residential and commercial sectors through 2015 under different policy scenarios: voluntary solid-state lighting adoption, implementation of lighting standards in new construction, and rebate programs or equivalent subsidies. Finally, we provide a measure of cost-effectiveness for solidstate lighting in the context of other climate change abatement policies.},

  abstract = {Facial expressions of emotion in humans are believed to be produced by contracting one's facial muscles, generally called action units. However, the surface of the face is also innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Here, we study the hypothesis that these visible facial colors allow observers to successfully transmit and visually interpret emotion even in the absence of facial muscle activation. To study this hypothesis, we address the following two questions. Are observable facial colors consistent within and differential between emotion categories and positive vs. negative valence? And does the human visual system use these facial colors to decode emotion from faces? These questions suggest the existence of an important, unexplored mechanism of the production of facial expressions of emotion by a sender and their visual interpretation by an observer. The results of our studies provide evidence in favor of our hypothesis. We show that people successfully decode emotion using these color features, even in the absence of any facial muscle activation. We also demonstrate that this color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements. These results support a revised model of the production and perception of facial expressions of emotion where facial color is an effective mechanism to visually transmit and decode emotion.},

Among the most notable biological functions are human circadian rhythms, which are bodily rhythms that, in constant darkness, oscillate with a period close to, but typically slightly longer than 24 hours. Twenty-four-hour light\textendash{}dark patterns incident on the retina are the major synchroniser of circadian rhythms to the local time on Earth. Entrainment of circadian rhythms has been implicated in health and well-being. Light can also elicit an acute alerting effect on people, similar to a `cup of coffee.'

Twenty-four participants (12 adolescents, 12 adults) were exposed to three lighting conditions during successive 4-h study nights that were separated by at least one week. In addition to a dim light ({$<$}5\,lux) control, participants were exposed to two light spectra (warm (2700\,K) and cool (5600\,K)) delivering a circadian stimulus of 0.25 at eye level. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of exposure duration, indicating that a longer duration exposure suppressed melatonin to a greater degree. The analysis further revealed a significant main effect of spectrum and a significant interaction between spectrum and participant age. For the adolescents, but not the adults, melatonin suppression was significantly greater after exposure to the 5600\,K intervention (43\%) compared to the 2700\,K intervention (29\%), suggesting an increased sensitivity to short-wavelength radiation. These results will be used to extend the model of human circadian phototransduction to incorporate factors such as exposure duration and participant age to better predict effective circadian stimulus.},

Participants experienced four experimental conditions: a dim light control, a high circadian stimulus true positive intervention and two Night Shift interventions delivering low and high correlated colour temperature light from the devices. Melatonin suppression did not significantly differ between the two Night Shift interventions, which indicates that changing the spectral composition of self-luminous displays without changing their brightness settings may be insufficient for preventing impacts on melatonin suppression.},

  abstract = {Light can elicit an alerting response in humans, independent from acute melatonin suppression. Recent studies have shown that red light significantly increases daytime and nighttime alertness. The main goal of the present study was to further investigate the effects of daytime light exposure on performance, biomarkers and measures of alertness. It was hypothesized that, compared to remaining in dim light, daytime exposure to narrowband long-wavelength (red) light or polychromatic (2568K) light would induce greater alertness and shorter response times. Thirteen subjects experienced three lighting conditions: dim light ({$<$}5lux), red light ({$\lambda$}max=631nm, 213lux, 1.1W/m2), and white light (2568K, 361lux, 1.1W/m2). The presentation order of the lighting conditions was counterbalanced across the participants and each participant saw a different lighting condition each week. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that red light can increase short-term performance as shown by the significant (p{$<$}0.05) reduced response time and higher throughput in performance tests during the daytime. There was a significant decrease (p{$<$}0.05) in alpha power and alpha\textendash{}theta power after exposure to the white light, but this alerting effect did not translate to better performance. Alpha power was significantly reduced after red light exposure in the middle of the afternoon. There was no significant effect of light on cortisol and alpha amylase. The present results suggest that red light can be used to increase daytime performance.},

Although qualitative comparisons between the human circadian and visual systems can be made, there still remains some uncertainty in quantitatively predicting exactly how the circadian system will respond to different light exposures reaching the retina. This paper discusses attempts to model the spectral sensitivity of the circadian system. Each of the models discussed here varies in terms of its complexity and its consideration of retinal neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Future testing to validate or improve any of these computational models will require a targeted hypothesis, as well as a suitably high level of experimental control before one model can be rejected in favour of another. Until specific hypotheses are formulated and tested, it would be premature to recommend international acceptance of any model or system of circadian photometry.},

The scientific literature has countless examples showing that spatial and temporal features of light influence the colors we see. Studying chromatic stimuli that vary over space, time, or direction of motion has a further benefit beyond predicting color appearance: the unveiling of otherwise concealed neural processes of color vision. Spatial or temporal stimulus variation uncovers multiple mechanisms of brightness and color perception at distinct levels of the visual pathway. Spatial variation in chromaticity and luminance can change perceived three-dimensional shape, an example of chromatic signals that affect a percept other than color. Chromatic objects in motion expose the surprisingly weak link between the chromaticity of objects and their physical direction of motion, and the role of color in inducing an illusory motion direction. Space, time, and motion\textemdash{}color's colleagues\textemdash{}reveal the richness of chromatic neural processing.},

All colors can be described in terms of four non-reducible `unique' hues: red, green, yellow, and blue [1]. These four hues are also the most common `focal' colors \textemdash{} the best examples of color terms in language [2]. The significance of the unique hues has been recognized since at least the 14th century [3] and is universal [4,5], although there is some individual variation [6,7]. Psychophysical linking hypotheses predict an explicit neural representation of unique hues at some stage of the visual system, but no such representation has been described [8]. The special status of the unique hues ``remains one of the central mysteries of color science'' [9]. Here we report that a population of recently identified cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkey contains an explicit representation of unique hues.},

The results stressed the importance of the spectral distribution with respect to effective wavelengths in causing colour degradation, and in general white LEDs resulted more suitable, in terms of fading prevention, than traditional halogen light sources.},

Besides certain ambient influences the main factor governing these effects is the spectral irradiance applied to the surface. As the photochemical efficiency of electromagnetic radiation depends on its wavelength it is desirable to know the effect of individual spectral components in order to estimate the damage potential of a certain light source. In this work the modifications of the reflectance spectra of 40 dyes and pigments relevant in historical book illumination resulting from irradiation by eight narrow band LED light sources are presented. The LED wavelengths cover the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Based on the measured reflectance spectra, color values are calculated and their evolution is studied as a function of the amount of radiation applied.},

It is unclear how this percept of ``pan-field colour'' comes about. We use novel stimuli\textemdash{}``colour chimeras''\textemdash{}to demonstrate a related visual phenomenon in which observers perceive rich colour throughout images with large achromatic regions. This percept appears to critically depend on natural scene statistics. By separately manipulating chromatic and structural content in such images, we demonstrate that both the spatial distribution of colour and the presence of recognizable scene structure contribute to the experience of pan-field colour in these stimuli. Our results suggest that this percept is unlikely to be due to a low-level colour spreading process. Instead, we suggest that mechanisms dependent on natural scenes' chromatic and luminance statistics provide the basis for the phenomenon.},

The results indicated that UVA and UVB had a significant fading effect, whereas visible light caused fading to a small extent. Specific wavelengths caused Blue wool to significantly fade, suggesting that the total irradiated UV energy may not be an appropriate index.

  abstract = {A new approach to identifying artifacts sensitive to visible light exposure, based on the direct measurement of the lightfastness of materials that compose the object, is described. An instrument has been constructed that is capable of identifying fugitive materials (more light sensitive than Blue Wool \#2) rapidly and essentially nondestructively. Accelerated light-fading tests on tiny (0.4 mm diameter) areas of an object are done while simultaneously monitoring the color change produced in the test area. The lightfastness determined in such microfading tests has been found to compare well with that measured in more conventional accelerated lightaging tests. The risks of damage to the artifacts from these microfading tests have been examined. By terminating the fading test when a small but definite color change has been produced, the risk of disfiguring the object by creating a visible bleached spot is judged to be very small. Exposure to the light intensities used in the microfading tester can heat test areas to as high as 50\textdegree{}C, so that low-melting materials such as waxes should be considered at risk of some degree of melting damage. For most art materials that are more heat tolerant, however, this technique holds great promise as a tool for recognizing very light-sensitive materials and for 'predicting the consequences of exhibition under particular lighting or atmospheric conditions.},

  abstract = {Organic colouring matters are faded by absorbed ultraviolet and visible radiation up to a critical wavelength, above which radiation is non-actinic even if strongly absorbed. This wavelength is generally related to the normal light fastness of the colouring matter, ``normal'' referring to the substrate for which it was originally developed, e.g. vat dyes on cotton, disperse dyes on acetate rayon. The critical wavelength decreases as the resistance to fading increases, being in the red when the light fastness is 1\textendash{}2 (minimum) and in the blue when it is 6\textendash{}8 (maximum); there are, however, some exceptions to this rule. As long-wave radiations preponderate in daylight and as the absorption bands are usually strongest in the visible spectrum, fugitive organic colouring matters are mainly faded by visible light, whilst those of high normal light fastness can in general be faded only by ultraviolet, violet, and blue light. The differences between the composition of actinic radiation constituting daylight and that emitted by the enclosed carbon arc have been shown to be relatively unimportant as a possible source of gross anomalies in light fastness testing based on comparison with light fastness standards. These differences do, however, render meaningless any attempts to equate one hour's lamp exposure with so many hours' sunshine.},

To understand the impact of these differences on pigment stability, the wavelength dependence of pigment discoloration was determined. Contrary to the expectation that lower wavelength photons induce more damage than higher wavelength ones, UV (394 nm), blue, and cyan light all lead to similar levels of discoloration of a pigment for the same level of radiant power. By understanding this wavelength dependence, it becomes possible to create white light LED lamps with a spectral composition tuned to minimize the degradation effect. An existing LED solution with a modified emission indeed resulted in 30\% less color change in the experiment than halogen. Furthermore, a method is proposed to optimize the LED spectra by tuning to the properties of each specific artifact. Simulations show that this can reduce the damage of the light source by 45\% in specific cases.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, museums are installing energy-saving light sources, such as LED (light emitting diode) lamps. LEDs represent an evolving technology; there are concerns about the effects of light spectra on artifacts, including textiles. Many LED models do not possess the same color rendering properties that observers are accustomed to, and it is important to understand the effects that spectra can play on dyed textiles. This research focuses on the visual effects of different light spectra, including those of LEDs, on textile colorants in order to gauge the range of color differences produced. Nine early synthetic dyes and one commercial fading standard were utilized. This paper summarizes our findings to date: that LED spectra with the same color temperature can render very different observable colors, especially with saturated colors. Saturated purples were found to be extremely hard to render accurately with LEDs. Other hues may also be compromised. Experimental work indicates that color temperature, illuminance level, and the commercial Color Rendering Index (CRI) are insufficient specifications for exhibitions LED light sources. An instrumental method for assessing LEDs before exhibition installation is suggested.},

  abstract = {Light plays a critical role in the regulation of numerous aspects of physiology and behaviour, including the entrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of sleep. These responses involve melanopsin (OPN4)-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) in addition to rods and cones. Nocturnal light exposure in rodents has been shown to result in rapid sleep induction, in which melanopsin plays a key role. However, studies have also shown that light exposure can result in elevated corticosterone, a response that is not compatible with sleep. To investigate these contradictory findings and to dissect the relative contribution of pRGCs and rods/cones, we assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep. Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4-/-), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. We go on to show that blue light evokes higher Fos induction in the SCN compared to the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), whereas green light produced greater responses in the VLPO. Collectively, our data demonstrates that nocturnal light exposure can have either an arousal- or sleep-promoting effect, and that these responses are melanopsin-mediated via different neural pathways with different spectral sensitivities. These findings raise important questions relating to how artificial light may alter behaviour in both the work and domestic setting.},

The dependent variables considered were reading time, reading errors and incorrect answers to a comprehension test. The main results demonstrated that these parameters of reading performance are all influenced by the five aforementioned chromatic conditions. These outcomes manifest similar trends in four groups of readers: children and adults combined with normal or dyslexic readers. Possible applied research and clinical applications are discussed together with some basic questions related to color vision suggesting that the main purposes of color for living beings is to generate wholeness, parts-whole organization and perceptual segmentation.},

All illuminations were set up with a photoperiod of 12 light: 12 dark.

Compared to WL, GL increased the amplitudes and mesors of positive elements (cClock, cBmal1/2) and reduced those of negative elements (cCry1/2, cPer2/3), in contrast to RL. The temporal patterns of cAanat mRNA and melatonin secretion have always been consistent with the positive genes. Besides, GL advanced the acrophases of the positive elements, cAanat and melatonin, but RL and BL showed the opposite effect. Thereby, GL could promote the secretion of melatonin by enhancing the expressions of positive clock genes and repressing the expressions of negative clock genes.

  abstract = {Deimatic displays are a type of anti-predator behaviour that startles the predator. They have received much recent theoretical attention, enabling the empirical study of this phenomenon within a predictive framework. It has long been known that bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua spp.), when approached by predators, open their mouth widely and expose a conspicuously coloured tongue. Here, we test whether such `full-tongue' displays are triggered by an imminent predatory attack in the Northern Bluetongue skink Tiliqua scincoides intermedia and examine whether this display behaviour is consistent with the predictions from deimatic display theory. First, we demonstrate that luminance at the rear of the tongue, which is only exposed during full-tongue displays, is almost twice as high for lizard and bird receivers compared to the tip of the tongue, and that tongue colouration is generally more conspicuous to a bird than a lizard visual system. Second, staged predatory encounters using model predators reveal that lizards primarily exhibit full-tongue displays in the final stages of a predatory attack. Lizards performed full-tongue displays congruent with the predictions associated with deimatic displays, i.e. rapid exposure of conspicuous elements from a previously inconspicuous state concurrently with aggressive defensive behaviour, most frequently during the final stages of a predatory encounter. Surprisingly, we also found that lizards vary the area of the tongue exposed during chemoexploratory tongue-flicks depending on whether a predator is present or absent.Significance statementBluetongue skinks have long been known to expose their large blue tongue in response to predatory threats. However, this behaviour has never been investigated empirically. Here, we use Northern Bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) to test whether this behaviour is consistent with predictions associated with deimatic displays. We show that the rear of their tongue is UV-blue and more conspicuous to predators compared to the tip and that this `full-tongue display' is only triggered in the final stages of a predatory attack.},

The circadian illuminance (CIL) and melatonin suppression value (MSV) were introduced as representative figures of merits for spectroscopically evaluating non-visual characteristics. A VR/AR-like custom-made instrument was used to study how the SPD of the display light source affects non-visual characteristics. Moreover, using multilayer thin-film filters, optimal conditions for minimizing the change of the visual color characteristics of the display while reducing the influence on the non-visual characteristics are also discussed. For the AR device, we found that its spectrum was mostly affected by external light rather than by the spectrum of the AR display itself.},

To wit, this dataset has at least 3 different sets of ground-truths. Typically, for a single algorithm a single ground-truth is used. But then different algorithms, whose performance is measured with respect to different ground-truths, are compared against each other and then ranked. This makes no sense. In fact it is nonsense. We show in this paper that there are also errors in how each ground-truth set was calculated. As a result, all performance rankings based on the Color Checker dataset - and there are scores of these - are ill-founded. In this paper, we re-generate a new 'recommended' set of ground-truth based on the calculation methodology described by Shi and Funt. We then review the performance evaluation of a range of illuminant estimation algorithms. Compared with the legacy ground-truths, we find that the difference in how algorithms perform can be large with many local rankings of algorithms being reversed. Finally, we draw the readers attention to our new 'open' data repository which, we hope, will allow the Color Checker set to be rehabilitated and, once again, to become a useful benchmark for illuminant estimation algorithms.},

In this paper, a measurement method and an instrument (the multidirectional spectroradiometer \textendash{} MuS) is proposed, which considers different light incidents and spectra simultaneously, therefore, enables measurement of light characteristics relevant for non-image-forming effects. The MuS consists of four spectroradiometers measuring in different directions. Four spectrometers using optical fibers were configured to measure the spectral irradiance within a wavelength range from 200 to 1100 nm with 5.7 nm pixel resolution. Application of the MuS facilitates a better understanding of the non-image-forming light characteristics of spaces. The MuS is tested with stable electric lighting and with dynamic daylight conditions and is proven reliable to perform continuous spectral measurements in different directions simultaneously. Results show a substantial difference in measured radiation magnitude and spectral distribution in different directions, which suggests varying impact on non-image-forming effects.},

  abstract = {With the concept of memory colors being considered to play a crucial role for many imaging and lighting applications, the questions how people assess the color appearance of familiar objects and what kind of fundamental characteristics can be derived from these assessments have extensively been studied in the past. However, all of the previous studies, the authors of this article are aware of, lack in realistic viewing and adaptation conditions. In the attempt of overcoming these deficiencies, a new experiment investigating the impact of long-term memory on the color appearance ratings of 12 familiar test objects was performed. The pooled observer data were modeled in CIECAM02 color space using bivariate Gaussian functions whose centroids define the corresponding memory color centers for each test object. Comparisons with previous results obtained by Smet et al. revealed no significant differences in the reported memory color centers, but showed distinct deviations in the covariance matrices defining the shape of the fitted distribution functions. It is supposed that this new set of functions will lead to significantly different results when being used for the construction of an updated memory-based color quality metric.},

  abstract = {We examined individual differences in the color appearance of nonspectral lights and asked how they might be related to individual differences in sensitivity to chromatic stimuli. Observers set unique hues for moderately saturated equiluminant stimuli by varying their hue angle within a plane defined by the LvsM and SvsLM cone-opponent axes that are thought to characterize early postreceptoral color coding. Unique red settings were close to the +L pole of the LvsM axis, while green, blue, and yellow settings clustered along directions intermediate to the LvsM and SvsLM axes and thus corresponded to particular ratios of LvsM to SvsLM activity. Interobserver differences in the unique hues were substantial. However, no relationship was found between hue settings and relative sensitivity to the LvsM and SvsLM axes. Moreover, interobserver variations in different unique hues were uncorrelated and were thus inconsistent with a common underlying factor such as relative sensitivity or changes in the spectral sensitivities of the cones. Thus for the moderately saturated lights we tested, the unique hues appear largely unconstrained by normal individual differences in the cone-opponent axes. In turn, this suggests that the perceived hue for these stimuli does not depend on fixed (common) physiological weightings of the cone-opponent axes or on fixed (common) color signals in the environment.},

The aim of this work was to elucidate these limits in relation to an ideal observer using color signals alone. Simulations were based on 50 hyperspectral images of natural scenes and daylight illuminants with correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Estimates were made of the (Shannon) information available from each scene, the redundancies in receptoral and postreceptoral coding, and the information retrieved by an observer identifying corresponding points across image pairs. For the largest illuminant difference, between 25,000 K and 4000 K, a postreceptoral transformation providing minimum redundancy yielded an efficiency of about 80\% in the information retrieved. This increased to about 89\% when the transformation was optimized directly for information retrieved, corresponding to an equivalent Gaussian noise amplitude of 3.0\% or to a mean of 3.6\texttimes{}104 distinct identifiable points per scene. Using color signals to retrieve information from natural scenes can approach ideal observer efficiency levels.},

Hyperspectral images of 20 such scenes were each subjected to a principal component analysis and then reproduced with a variable number of basis functions. The quality of the color approximation under daylight illumination was quantified theoretically in CIELAB space and psychophysically by spatial and temporal two-alternative forced-choice measurements in which the original and the approximated images were compared on a calibrated color monitor. Although five basis functions produced on average unit error in CIELAB space, original images were visually indistinguishable from their approximations only if there were at least eight basis functions. The combination of the spectral diversity of the natural world and the observed levels of color discrimination suggest that estimates of the minimum number of basis functions necessary to reproduce natural scenes may need to be revised upward.},

It is also shown that changes in illuminant may cause colors to no longer match and the relations between individual colors to vary. These failures are generally well described by a measure of the randomness of the colors in scenes, the Shannon entropy.

  shorttitle = {Correlation and {{Interaction Visualization}} of {{Altmetric Indicators Extracted From Scholarly Social Network Activities}}},
  abstract = {Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations. Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58\% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators. Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.  [J Med Internet Res 2013;15(11):e259]},

  abstract = {If surfaces in a scene are to be distinguished by their color, their neural representation at some level should ideally vary little with the color of the illumination. Four possible neural codes were considered: von-Kries-scaled cone responses from single points in a scene, spatial ratios of cone responses produced by light reflected from pairs of points, and these quantities obtained with sharpened (opponent-cone) responses. The effectiveness of these codes in identifying surfaces was quantified by information-theoretic measures. Data were drawn from a sample of 25 rural and urban scenes imaged with a hyperspectral camera, which provided estimates of surface reflectance at 10-nm intervals at each of 1344 ϫ 1024 pixels for each scene. In computer simulations, scenes were illuminated separately by daylights of correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Points were sampled randomly in each scene and identified according to each of the codes. It was found that the maximum information preserved under illuminant changes varied with the code, but for a particular code it was remarkably stable across the different scenes. The standard deviation over the 25 scenes was, on average, approximately 1 bit, suggesting that the neural coding of surface color can be optimized independent of location for any particular range of illuminants.},

First, when comparing the insides and outsides of the objects, we observed that the insides were lighter~than the skins, and that the hues of the insides and skins were significantly correlated (circular~correlation 0.638). Second, we compared the color distribution within each object to corresponding human~color discrimination thresholds. We found a significant correlation (0.75) between the orientation of ellipses fit to~the chromaticity distributions of our fruits and vegetables with the orientations of interpolated MacAdam~discrimination ellipses. This indicates a relationship between sensory processing and the characteristic~of environmental objects. ~ If for some reason you need access to the original RAW data from the camera sensor, that can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186372 However, it is only posted for preservation purposes.

  abstract = {Imaging techniques inform the conservation, research, and understanding of museum collections. Two types of imaging techniques were examined in this study: infrared (IR) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Reflected IR imaging is well established as an investigative tool for conservation providing information about condition, materials, and manufacture beyond visible light documentation. Reflected IR imaging results in two-dimensional images, which are limited in how they represent 3D objects. Three-dimensional imaging techniques, such as white light scanning and photogrammetry, extend the possibilities of digitization by recording the geometry and texture of an object. Reflected IR imaging, photogrammetry, and white light scanning were used to document six objects from the Freud Museum and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. The present study provides examples of reflected IR imaging for enhanced detection of features of 3D cultural heritage objects; discusses the potential of integrating reflected IR and 3D imaging to more fully document features of 3D objects; and investigates two 3D imaging techniques, white light scanning and photogrammetry. The study assesses the two 3D imaging techniques, one more expensive and the other more accessible, to discover whether there is a significant difference in performance for the purpose of resolving the details recorded by reflected IR imaging.},

Partitioning data into 50:50 training and test sets, correct classification in separating unflawed versus blemished areas ranged from 62 to 96\% (Year I) and from 73 to 85\% (Year II). The algorithm which yielded the highest correct classification was the multi-layer back propagation but minor variation was found for number of hidden nodes or neural net architecture. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Fruit reflectance spectra of five apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars (Zhigulevskoe, Antonovka, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious and Renet Simirenko) with a wide range of peel pigment (chlorophylls a and b , carotenoids and anthocyanins) content have been studied to develop non-destructive techniques for pigment assessment. In addition to chlorophylls, positions of in vivo absorption maxima were established for carotenoids (480, 455 and a shoulder at 425 nm) and for anthocyanins (near 550 nm). In anthocyanin-free fruit, a close relationship between reflectance at 550 nm (R550) and 700 nm (R700) has been found (r2  /0.95). In fruit with chlorophyll content more than 5 nmol/cm2, the reflectance near 678 nm was insensitive to a variation in chlorophylls, whereas, reflectance in the bands 550 {\'A}/650 nm and 690 {\'A}/705 nm remained sensitive to chlorophyll content in a wide range of its variation. The reflectance ratios, R800/ R700 and R800/R640, were directly proportional to total chlorophyll content ranging from 0.4 to 11 nmol/cm2 (r2  /0.93). The reflectance in the band 520 {\'A}/530 nm was found to be dependent mostly on carotenoids absorption. The index R800(1/R520(/1/R700) was suggested for estimation of carotenoid content in the range 0.6 {\'A}/4.5 nmol/cm2. The index for assessment of a carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio was proposed in the form, (R480(/R678)/R800. Reflectance in the green region of the spectrum proved to be sensitive to anthocyanin content. The index R800(1/R550(/1/R700) was developed to estimate anthocyanin content in peel ranging from 2.5 to 50 nmol/cm2; the determination coefficient of the index with anthocyanin content was higher than 0.93.},

  title = {Common Features of Circadian Timekeeping in Diverse Organisms},
  issn = {2468-8673},
  abstract = {Cell autonomous circadian clocks are ubiquitous. They coordinate with each other and relate to a more centralized `master' clock. Between taxonomic groups, the `master' clock significantly varies in its location and structure from a decentralized organization in Drosophila and zebrafish, to an interacting circuitry of circadian oscillators in the retina, pineal gland and hypothalamus in non-mammalian vertebrates, and a centralized hypothalamic clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of mammals. Endogenous clocks are synchronized directly or indirectly by cyclicity in the environment, e.g. daily cycles of light and darkness, temperature, food availability and social cues, and control daily rhythms in the behaviour and physiology of animals. These clocks keep time by molecular processes that are organized in an autoregulatory transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL), which has been found evolutionarily conserved. TTFL comprises of gene sets functionally arranged in the positive, negative and accessory molecular loops. There is genetic transcription of `clock genes' and post-translation activities of the ``clock proteins'' with a time lag which defines the time. However, how TTFL maintains circa 24\,hour temporal programs is still not well understood.},

  abstract = {Life on earth is subject to alternating cycles of day and night imposed by the rotation of the earth. Consequently, living things have evolved photodetective systems to synchronize their physiology and behavior with the external light-dark cycle. This form of photodetection is unlike the familiar ``image vision,'' in that the basic information is light or darkness over time, independent of spatial patterns. ``Nonimage'' vision is probably far more ancient than image vision and is widespread in living species. For mammals, it has long been assumed that the photoreceptors for nonimage vision are also the textbook rods and cones. However, recent years have witnessed the discovery of a small population of retinal ganglion cells in the mammalian eye that express a unique visual pigment called melanopsin. These ganglion cells are intrinsically photosensitive and drive a variety of nonimage visual functions. In addition to being photoreceptors themselves, they also constitute the major conduit for rod and cone signals to the brain for nonimage visual functions such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. Here we review what is known about these novel mammalian photoreceptors.},

Afterward, the color contrasts of six groups of color patches were optimized under four different constraints of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) general color rendering index (\emph{R}\textsubscript{a}), i.e., \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 0, \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 60, \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 80, and \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 90, manifesting their significant color contrast enhancement under the optimized light sources compared with those under the simulated CIE A, D50, D65, and D75 light sources. Further, two biological samples, pork tissues and porcine heart, were optimized under the four constraints of \emph{R}\textsubscript{a}. The results show that even in the case of \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 90, the optimized {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>\Delta{}<$}/mi{$>$} {$<$}msubsup{$>$} {$<$}mi{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$>$} {$<$}mn{$>$}00{$<$}/mn{$>$} {$<$}mo{$>$}*{$<$}/mo{$>$} {$<$}/msubsup{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}/math{$>$} {$<$}/inline-formula{$>$} values for the two specimens are, respectively, 4.13 and 3.20 higher than those under the D75 light source. More importantly, the developed method also provides a flexible lighting solution to color contrast enhancement.},

  abstract = {The human visual system seems to be particularly efficient at detecting faces. This efficiency sometimes comes at the cost of wrongfully seeing faces in arbitrary patterns, including famous examples such as a rock configuration on Mars or a toast's roast patterns. In machine vision, face detection has made considerable progress and has become a standard feature of many digital cameras. The arguably most wide-spread algorithm for such applications (``Viola-Jones'' algorithm) achieves high detection rates at high computational efficiency. To what extent do the patterns that the algorithm mistakenly classifies as faces also fool humans? We selected three kinds of stimuli from real-life, first-person perspective movies based on the algorithm's output: correct detections (``real faces''), false positives (``illusory faces'') and correctly rejected locations (``non faces''). Observers were shown pairs of these for 20 ms and had to direct their gaze to the location of the face. We found that illusory faces were mistaken for faces more frequently than non faces. In addition, rotation of the real face yielded more errors, while rotation of the illusory face yielded fewer errors. Using colored stimuli increases overall performance, but does not change the pattern of results. When replacing the eye movement by a manual response, however, the preference for illusory faces over non faces disappeared. Taken together, our data show that humans make similar face-detection errors as the Viola-Jones algorithm, when directing their gaze to briefly presented stimuli. In particular, the relative spatial arrangement of oriented filters seems of relevance. This suggests that efficient face detection in humans is likely to be pre-attentive and based on rather simple features as those encoded in the early visual system.},

  shorttitle = {Melanopsin {{Bistability}}},
  abstract = {In addition to rods and cones, the human retina contains light-sensitive ganglion cells that express melanopsin, a photopigment with signal transduction mechanisms similar to that of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments (IRP). Like fly rhodopsins, melanopsin acts as a dual-state photosensitive flip-flop in which light drives both phototransduction responses and chromophore photoregeneration that bestows independence from the retinoid cycle required by rods and cones to regenerate photoresponsiveness following bleaching by light. To explore the hypothesis that melanopsin in humans expresses the properties of a bistable photopigment in vivo we used the pupillary light reflex (PLR) as a tool but with methods designed to study invertebrate photoreceptors. We show that the pupil only attains a fully stabilized state of constriction after several minutes of light exposure, a feature that is consistent with typical IRP photoequilibrium spectra. We further demonstrate that previous exposure to long wavelength light increases, while short wavelength light decreases the amplitude of pupil constriction, a fundamental property of IRP difference spectra. Modelling these responses to invertebrate photopigment templates yields two putative spectra for the underlying R and M photopigment states with peaks at 481 nm and 587 nm respectively. Furthermore, this bistable mechanism may confer a novel form of ``photic memory'' since information of prior light conditions is retained and shapes subsequent responses to light. These results suggest that the human retina exploits fly-like photoreceptive mechanisms that are potentially important for the modulation of non-visual responses to light and highlights the ubiquitous nature of photoswitchable photosensors across living organisms.},

We find that a three dimensional Euclidean representation accounts for most of the variation in the Euclidean distances among the 1269 Munsell color spectra. We interpret the three dimensional Euclidean representation of the spectral data in terms of the Munsell color space. In addition, we analyzed a data set with a large number of natural objects and found that the spectral profiles required four basis factors for adequate representation in Euclidean space.

  volume = {81},
  issn = {00344257},
  abstract = {Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments. D 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {An image is often represented by a set of detected features. We get an enormous compression by representing images in this way. Furthermore, we get a representation which is little affected by small amounts of noise in the image. However, features are typically chosen in an ad hoc manner. \textbackslash{}Ve show how a good set of features can be obtained using sufficient statistics. The idea of sparse data representation naturally arises. We treat the I-dimensional and 2-dimensional signal reconstruction problem to make our ideas concrete.},

  abstract = {Recent computational models of color vision demonstrate that it is possible to achieve exact color constancy over a limited range of lights and surfaces described by linear models. The success of these computational models hinges on whether any sizable range of surface spectral reflectances can be described by a linear model with about three parameters. In the first part of this paper, I analyze two large sets of empirical surface spectral reflectances and examine three conjectures concerning constraints on surface reflectance: (1) that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model with a small number of parameters, (2) that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model composed of band-limited functions with a small number of parameters, and (3) that the shape of the spectral-sensitivity curves of human vision enhance the fit between empirical surface reflectances and a linear model. I conclude that the first and second conjectures hold for the two sets of spectral reflectances analyzed but that the number of parameters required to model the spectral reflectances is five to seven, not three. A reanalysis of the empirical data that takes human visual sensitivity into account gives more promising results. The linear models derived provide excellent fits to the data with as few as three or four parameters, confirming the third conjecture. The results suggest that constraints on possible surface-reflectance functions and the ``filtering'' properties of the shapes of the spectral-sensitivity curves of photoreceptors can both contribute to color constancy. In the last part of the paper I derive the relation between the number of photoreceptor classes present in vision and the ``filtering'' properties of each class. The results of this analysis reverse a conclusion reached by Barlow: the ``filtering'' properties of human photoreceptors are consistent with a trichromatic visual system that is color constant.},

  abstract = {Many recent computational models of surface color perception presuppose information about illumination in scenes. The models differ primarily in the physical process each makes use of as a cue to the illuminant. We evaluated whether the human visual system makes use of any of three of the following candidate illuminant cues: (1) specular highlight, (2) full surface specularity [Lee, H. C. (1986). Method for computing the scene-illuminant chromaticity from specular highlights. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 3(10), 1694\textendash{}1699; D'Zmura, M., \& Lennie, P. (1986). Mechanisms of color constancy. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 3(10), 1662\textendash{}1672], and (3) uniform background. Observers viewed simulated scenes binocularly in a computer-controlled Wheatstone stereoscope. All simulated scenes contained a uniform background plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight and a small number of specular, colored spheres resting on the uniform background. Scenes were rendered under either standard illuminant D65 or standard illuminant A. Observers adjusted the color of a small, simulated test patch to appear achromatic. In a series of experiments we perturbed the illuminant color signaled by each candidate cue and looked for an influence of the changed cue on achromatic settings. We found that the specular highlight cue had a significant influence, but that the influence was asymmetric: greater when the base illuminant, CIE standard Illuminant A, was perturbed in the direction of Illuminant D65 than vice versa. Neither the full surface specularity cue nor the background cue had any observable influence. The lack of influence of the background cue is likely due to the placement of the test patch in front of the background rather than, as is typical, embedded in the background.},

  abstract = {Simple color-difference formulae and pictorial images have
traditionally been used to estimate the visual impact of color errors
introduced by image-reproduction processes. But the limited gamut of RGB
cameras constrains such analyses, particularly of natural scenes. The
purpose of this work was to estimate visual sensitivity to color errors
introduced deliberately into pictures synthesized from hyperspectral
images of natural scenes without gamut constraints and to compare
discrimination thresholds expressed in CIELAB and S-CIELAB color spaces.
From each original image, a set of approximate images with variable color
errors were generated and displayed on a calibrated RGB color monitor. The
threshold for perceptibility of the errors was determined in a
paired-comparison experiment. In agreement with previous studies, it was
found that discrimination between original and approximate images needed
on average a CIELAB color difference
{$\Delta$}Eab* of about 2.2. Although a large
variation of performance across the nine images tested was found when
errors were expressed in CIELAB units, little variation was obtained when
they were expressed in S-CIELAB units.},

In their model, the tristimulus response to reflected light is accurately approximated by a linear transformation of the tristimulus response to illumination, allowing the prediction of several perceptual characteristics of human vision. Later, Vazquez-Corral et al (2012) [2] built a bridge between Philipona \& O'Regan's model and von Kries-like approaches to color constancy in computer vision by showing that the linear operators could be diagonalized in a common basis. However both of these studies required specifying a particular dataset of illuminants. We will show in this paper that it is possible to compute adequate linear operators and a common basis for diagonalization without specifying any particular set of illuminants.},

A key task is to answer how many basis functions of a linear model are necessary for a given accuracy of representation. While the most common application is the reproduction of color and images, which highly relate to human perception, it is important to understand the relationship between human perceptual tolerance of spectral images and the number of basis functions of the corresponding linear models. In this study several data sets and psychophysical studies have been used to address the question of how many basis functions are necessary to represent a spectral image so that it is indistinguishable from the original (complete) representation. The results show that the number of basis function required is highly image dependent: 3 to 8 basis functions needed for different types of images.},

  abstract = {Psychophysical studies suggest that different colors have different perceptual status: red and blue for example are thought of as elementary sensations whereas yellowish green is not. The dominant account for such perceptual asymmetries attributes them to specificities of the neuronal representation of colors. Alternative accounts involve cultural or linguistic arguments. What these accounts have in common is the idea that there are no asymmetries in the physics of light and surfaces that could underlie the perceptual structure of colors, and this is why neuronal or cultural processes must be invoked as the essential underlying mechanisms that structure color perception. Here, we suggest a biological approach for surface reflection properties that takes into account only the information about light that is accessible to an organism given the photopigments it possesses, and we show that now asymmetries appear in the behavior of surfaces with respect to light. These asymmetries provide a classification of surface properties that turns out to be identical to the one observed in linguistic color categorization across numerous cultures, as pinned down by cross cultural studies. Further, we show that data from psychophysical studies about unique hues and hue cancellation are consistent with the viewpoint that stimuli reported by observers as special are those associated with this singularity-based categorization of surfaces under a standard illuminant. The approach predicts that unique blue and unique yellow should be aligned in chromatic space while unique red and unique green should not, a fact usually conjectured to result from nonlinearities in chromatic pathways.},

  abstract = {The surface reflectance function of many common materials varies slowly over the visible wavelength range. For this reason, linear models with a small number of bases (5-8) are frequently used for representation and estimation of these functions. In other signal representation and recovery applications, it has been recently demonstrated that dictionary based sparse representations can outperform linear model approaches. In this paper, we describe methods for building dictionaries for sparse estimation of reflectance functions. We describe a method for building dictionaries that account for the measurement system; in estimation applications these dictionaries outperform the ones designed for sparse representation without accounting for the measurement system. Sparse recovery methods typically outperform traditional linear methods by 20-40\% (in terms of RMSE).},

Second, we propose to calculate correlation values between the image color gamut and the reference illuminant gamut, rather than between the image pixels and the illuminant gamuts. Third, we introduce a new image scaling operation with an adjustable parameter to adjust overall intensity differences between images and find a good fit to the illuminant gamuts. Finally, the image processing algorithms incorporating these changes are evaluated using a real image database.},

First, the system acquires two images: one is an ordinary image of the scene under ambient light and the other is a corresponding image in which light from the camera flash is added to the scene. Second, the image pair is analyzed to obtain an image that represents the scene as if it had been illuminated by the flash alone. Third, the flashonly image is used to estimate object reflectance functions. Fourth, using the estimated reflectance functions, the ambient illumination spectral power distribution is estimated. We present results that evaluate the method's stability with respect to changes in the mean reflectance function of the scene. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current implementation and alternative implementations.},

Natural illuminant spectra of 238 samples measured in temperate forests were characterized by principal-component analysis. The spectra can be accurately approximated by the mean and the first two principal components. Compared with illumination under open skies, the loci of forest illuminants are displaced toward the green region in the chromaticity plots, and unlike open sky illumination they cannot be characterized by correlated color temperature. We show that it is possible to recover illuminant spectra accurately from digital video images by a linear least-squares-fit estimation technique. The use of digital video data in spectral analysis provides a promising new approach to the studies of the spatial and temporal variation of illumination in natural scenes and the understanding of color vision in natural environments.},

This property has been estimated by the volume of the object color solid in a nearly uniform color space based on the DIN99d color difference formula. Three optimized spectra produce about 11\% - 13\% larger volume than the standard D65 illuminant which simulates natural daylight and improve especially the red-green color discrimination. The optimal spectra are the result of similar optimization processes, but differ in shapes, except the common gap in light power in the region 570 nm - 610 nm.},

Differences were found between hardwoods and softwoods and between clear cloudy days. An energy maximum at 550 nm, a minimum at 670 to 680 nm, and a very high maximum in the near infrared occurred under all species. Four components of light within a plant canopy can be distinguished: both beam solar radiation and diffused sky radiation are transmitted both directly and indirectly (reflected and scattered). Separate consideration of each of these components leads to great understanding of similarities and differences between light regimes in different stands.},

The book explains the principles of microclimatology and illustrates how they apply to a wide array of subfields. Those new to the field will find it especially valuable as a guide to understanding and quantifying the vast and ever-increasing literature on the subject. This edition has been revised to keep abreast of current research in microclimatology, to provide more examples of work from North America, and to more clearly illustrate how surface energy fluxes are linked to the nature of the surface environment. The authors have added discussions dealing with the speed of sound, the use of vegetative barriers to reduce sound, and physiological control of energy and moisture exchanges. They have also expanded the discussion of microclimatic effects on animal and human behavior and dwellings. Designed as an introductory text for students in environmental science, this book will also be an essential reference for scientists seeking a clear understanding of the nature and physical basis of the climate near the ground, and its interactions with the biosphere.},

  abstract = {Light filtered through the forest canopy is the most variable physical factor in tropical forests, both in space and time. Vegetation geometry, sun angle, and weather generate five light environments, which greatly differ in intensity and spectrum. Forest light spectra can directly affect photosynthesis, plant morphogenesis, visual communication, and the effectiveness of plant-animal interactions. For animals, the apparent simplicity of five light environments is complicated by different types of contrast with the optical background which greatly modify the conspicuousness of visual signals. The purpose of this paper is to describe peculiarities of light in tropical forest, and to review the effects of light intensity and especially quality on plants and animals. Ecophysiological adaptations of plants to cope with contrasting light environments operate at daily, seasonal and life time-scales. Ambient light quality acts as a signal for both animals and plants, and consequences on plant growth, colour display, and signal design are examined. An analysis of the range of spectral parameters along a deforestation gradient is presented, testing if sites with more variation in light could support more species which are light-environment specialists. It is suggested that light quality measurement may be used to estimate the structural impact of forest exploitation, and that gives us the information necessary for a functional explanation of anthropogenic effects on tropical forest diversity.},

  title = {Real-Time {{Rendering}} of {{Plant Leaves}}},
  isbn = {978-1-59593-364-5},
  abstract = {This paper presents a framework for the real-time rendering of plant leaves with global illumination effects. Realistic rendering of leaves requires a sophisticated appearance model and accurate lighting computation. For leaf appearance we introduce a parametric model that describes leaves in terms of spatially-variant BRDFs and BTDFs. These BRDFs and BTDFs, incorporating analysis of subsurface scattering inside leaf tissues and rough surface scattering on leaf surfaces, can be measured from real leaves. More importantly, this description is compact and can be loaded into graphics hardware for fast run-time shading calculations, which are essential for achieving high frame rates. For lighting computation, we present an algorithm that extends the Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) approach to all-frequency lighting for leaves. In particular, we handle the combined illumination effects due to lowfrequency environment light and high-frequency sunlight. This is done by decomposing the local incident radiance of sunlight into direct and indirect components. The direct component, which contains most of the high frequencies, is not pre-computed with spherical harmonics as in PRT; instead it is evaluated on-the-fly using pre-computed light-visibility convolution data. We demonstrate our framework by the rendering of a variety of leaves and assemblies thereof.},

Reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance parameters are taken from measurements of real plants and integrated into a parameterized, dynamic global illumination model. When the model is combined with fast shadow rays, traced on a GPU, near real-time cinematic relighting is achievable for forest scenes containing hundreds of millions of polygons.},

  volume = {63},
  issn = {00129615},
  abstract = {Forests exhibit much variation in light environments, and this can affect communication among animals, communication between animals and plants, photosynthesis, and plant morphogenesis. Light environments are caused by, and can be predicted from, the geometry of the light paths, the weather conditions, and the time of day. The structure of forests leads to four major light habitats when the sun is not blocked by clouds: forest shade, woodland shade, small gaps, and large gaps. These are characterized by yellow-green, blue-gray, reddish, and "white" ambient light spectra, respectively. When the sun is blocked by clouds, the spectra of these four habitats converge on that of large gaps and open areas, so the single light environment during cloudy weather will be called open/cloudy. An additional light environment (early/late) is associated with low sun angles (near dawn or dusk); it is purplish. Each light environment is well defined and was found in forests of Trinidad, Panama, Costa Rica, Australia, California, and Florida. Scattered literature references suggest similar patterns elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Java. Perceived colors of animals, flowers, and fruits depend upon the interaction between ambient light color and the reflectance color of the animal or plant parts. As a result, an animal or plant may have a different appearance in each environment, i.e., a color pattern may be relatively cryptic in some light environments while relatively conspicuous in others. This has strong implications for the joint evolution of visual signals and vision, as well as microhabitat choice. Plant growth and form may also be affected by variation in the color of forest light.},

The spectrum of non-intercepted light in each canopy level is the same as that of incident light above the canopy (input parameter), whereas the spectrum of transmitted light depends on leaf area index (LAI) and the mean transmission spectrum of leaves. The model was tested in a forest and provided adequate predictions of measured values. Stronger deviations were produced in the near infrared (NIR) waveband in lower canopy levels. Multiple regression between LAI, as the dependent variable, and spectral characteristics (Blue, Green, Red and NIR intensities) had an r2 of 0.926. As a complement to other methods, I suggest light spectrum analysis as a non-destructive technique for estimating LAI in forest canopies.},

By uniform sampling of this, we collected 84 color signals from each color samples and combined them to form a training dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied on the selected training dataset to find the basis vectors and the number of color signals needed for estimation. We apply the Wiener estimation with different order of polynomials to estimate the color signal of color samples.

  abstract = {Preservation of spectral color information of a set of surface colors under 36 different light sources are evaluated. Two measures of information are used, the energy and relative entropy. The energy is assessed by the eigendecomposition method. It is found that while 9 eigenvectors are necessary for full presentation of the spectral reflectances of surface colors, 5\textendash{}8 eigenvectors are adequate to fully characterize the total variances of radiance spectrum, depending on light sources. Results also show that, the derived eigenvectors are sparse in some wavelengths mostly for the sources with limited numbers of emission bands. It is found that a significant spectral information loss occurs due to the illumination of surface colors. The Kullback- Leibler divergence measure is used to compare the relative entropy between reflectance spectra of objects and the corresponding radiance spectra of samples under each light source. Results show that there are big differences between the light sources in relative entropy between the reflectance spectra and the radiance spectra of objects. Based on energy and relative entropy considerations, the tri-band mixed-color white light LEDs generally have the highest loss of spectral information before the projection of radiance data over the reciver.},

In practice, however, one-step chromatic adaptation models, that avoid the use of the intermediate CIE illuminant E, are also employed. Tests using the one-step CAT16 model indicate failures of both the symmetry and transitivity properties, except in the case where the degree of adaptation D is equal to unity. The magnitude of these failures depends on the specific illuminants selected, and increases as the degree of adaptation decreases. From four possible two-step CAT16 models, we have identified two that obey the symmetry and transitivity properties, one with slightly better predictions of the experimental corresponding-color datasets available in the literature, and more consistent with the one-step CAT16 model. The findings of this article confirm that, for incomplete adaptation, the use of the one-step CAT is incorrect, and we propose that the use of a two-step CAT16 model be mandatory for future applications.},

Such stimuli are uncharacteristic of natural images, and we examined whether visual discomfort more generally increases with deviations from the spatial and chromatic properties of natural scenes. Observers rated the level of discomfort or artistic merit in color images generated from noise or random overlapping rectangles (Mondrians). In one set, the slopes of the amplitude spectra for luminance or chromatic contrast were varied independently to create images ranging from strongly blurred to sharpened relative to a `natural' 1/f spectrum. Perceived blur was dominated by the luminance slopes, with discomfort rated lowest for \$ 1/f spectra. In a second set of focused Mondrians, color was varied along different axes in the L \^ M versus S \^ LM chromatic plane. Discomfort ratings were lowest around bluish \^ yellowish axes that are again typical of natural outdoor scenes. A final set varied in the levels of both luminance and chromatic contrast. Discomfort increased with increasing color contrast or decreasing luminance contrast, and tended toward lower ratings for images with balanced levels of luminance and color contrast. Notably, these ratings of discomfort were not related to judgments of artistic merit. Thus, for both spatial and chromatic content, the least aversive images corresponded to characteristic properties of the natural visual environment, and may reflect a normalization of visual coding to the natural world.},

  abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or \textendash{} maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},

This paper presents the results of a I-year experiment using a towermounted spectroradiometer to measure the seasonal changes in the nadir reflectance properties of ash and beech canopies. Seasonal variations in reflectance in red wavelengths were found to be inversely related to percentage cover, whilst variations in near-infrared reflectance were directly related to percentage cover although for both wavelength regions changes in reflectance were not always exactly synchronous with changes in percentage cover. A strong rectilinear relation was observed between NDV( and percentage cover when data from both species were combined. The shape of the seasonal NOV! profile revealed differences between the two species that was ascribed to phenological differences between ash and beech canopies. The position of the wavelength of maximum slope in the region 680-750 nm, was found to shift between two domains depending on the particular association of scene clements presented to the sensor as canopy cover changed.},

  abstract = {Modern accounts of color appearance differ in whether they assume that the perceptual primaries (e.g., white and the unique hues of red, green, blue, and yellow) correspond to unique states determined by the spectral sensitivities of the observer or by the spectral statistics of the environment. We examined the interaction between observers and their environments by asking how color perception should vary if appearance depends on fixed responses in a set of color channels, when the sensitivities of these channels are adapted in plausible ways to different environments. Adaptation was modeled as gain changes in the cones and in multiple postreceptoral channels tuned to different directions in color\textendash{}luminance space. Gains were adjusted so that the average channel responses were equated across two environments or for the same environment during different seasons, based on sets of natural outdoor scenes (Webster et al., 2007). Because of adaptation, even observers with a shared underlying physiology should perceive color in significantly and systematically different ways when they are exposed to and thus adapted by different contexts. These include differences in achromatic settings (owing to variations in the average chromaticity of locations) and differences in perceived hue (because of differences in scene contrasts). Modeling these changes provides a way of simulating how colors might be experienced by individuals in different color environments and provides a measure of how much color appearance might be modulated for a given observer by variations in the environment.},

  title = {The {{Retinal Basis}} of {{Vertebrate Color Vision}}},
  abstract = {Vertebrate color vision is evolutionarily ancient. Jawless fish evolved four main spectral types of cone photoreceptor, almost certainly complemented by retinal circuits to process chromatic opponent signals. Subsequent evolution of photoreceptors and visual pigments are now documented for many vertebrate lineages and species, giving insight into evolutionary variation and ecological adaptation of color vision. We look at organization of the photoreceptor mosaic and the functions different types of cone in teleost fish, primates, and birds and reptiles. By comparison less is known about the underlying neural processing. Here we outline the diversity of vertebrate color vision and summarize our understanding of how spectral information picked up by animal photoreceptor arrays is adapted to natural signals. We then turn to the question of how spectral information is processed in the retina. Here, the quite well known and comparatively \&lsquo;simple\&rsquo; system of mammals such as mice and primates reveals some evolutionarily conserved features such as the mammalian BlueON system which compares short and long wavelength receptors signals. We then survey our current understanding of the more complex circuits of fish, amphibians, birds and reptiles. Together, these clades make up more than 90\% of vertebrate species, yet we know disturbingly little about their neural circuits for colour vision beyond the photoreceptors. Here, long-standing work on goldfish, freshwater turtles and other species is being complemented by new insights gained from the experimentally amendable retina of zebrafish. From this body of work, one thing is clear: The retinal basis of colour vision in non-mammalian vertebrates is substantially richer compared to mammals: Diverse and complex spectral tunings are established at the level of the cone output via horizontal cell feedforward circuits. From here, zebrafish use cone-selective wiring in bipolar cells to set-up color opponent synaptic layers in the inner retina, which in turn lead a large diversity of color-opponent channels for transmission to the brain. However, while we are starting to build an understanding of the richness of spectral properties in some of these species\&rsquo; retinal neurons, little is known about inner retinal connectivity and cell-type identify.\&nbsp; To gain an understanding of their actual circuits, and thus to build a more generalised understanding of the vertebrate retinal basis of color vision, it will be paramount to expand ongoing efforts in deciphering the retinal circuits of non-mammalian models.},

  abstract = {Light is an important factor in the conservation of museum collections because of its strong electromagnetic characteristic that can degrade artifacts. To investigate the effects of illumination on paintings, particularly in museums equipped with popular light emitting diode (LED) lamp systems, we investigated the fading process of traditional Korean pigments. We used four illumination conditions: a combination of high and low color rendering index (CRI) at two light temperatures of Tcold\,=\,5600\,K and Twarm\,=\,3200\,K. Among all samples tested, realgar, also known as Wunghwang in Korea, showed the most marked change in color. UV spectrometric analyses after 100\,h of exposure at 11 000 and at 5500\,lux showed high color differences exceeding the color change threshold under all illumination conditions. When the illumination intensity was reduced to 300\,lux, Tcold lamps showed a faster fading process than Twarm lamps did, suggesting that appropriate illuminating conditions can reduce the adverse effects of museum lighting systems. A further experiment using narrow-band, single-color, LED lamps showed how specific wavelength bands could influence the fading of artifacts In particular, we newly confirmed that discoloration of Wunghwang could be induced by the illumination of green light, in addition to blue light generally known to induce discoloration. These results demonstrate that the fading of a specific pigment of the artifacts in museum collections can be minimized by tuning the intensities of the wavelengths of light emitted by the museums' lighting systems.},

We analyzed results of the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color categories come about. We show that potential methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers. These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color usefulness.},

  abstract = {The more than twenty contributions in this book, all new and previously unpublished, provide an up-to-date survey of contemporary research on computational modeling of the visual system. The approaches represented range from neurophysiology to psychophysics, and from retinal function to the analysis of visual cues to motion, color, texture, and depth. The contributions are linked thematically by a consistent consideration of the links between empirical data and computational models in the study of visual function.An introductory chapter by Edward Adelson and James Bergen gives a new and elegant formalization of the elements of early vision. Subsequent sections treat receptors and sampling, models of neural function, detection and discrimination, color and shading, motion and texture, and 3D shape. Each section is introduced by a brief topical review and summary.Michael S. Landy is Associate Professor of Psychology at New York University where J. Anthony Movshon is Professor of Neural Science and Psychology and Director of the Center for Neural Science.Contributors: Edward H. Adelson. Albert J. Ahumada, Jr., James R. Bergen. David G. Birch.

  abstract = {Color has been scientifically investigated by linking color appearance to colorimetric measurements of the light that enters the eye. However, the main purpose of color perception is not to determine the properties of incident light, but to aid the visual perception of objects and materials in our environment. We review the state of the art on object colors, color constancy, and color categories to gain insight into the functional aspects of color perception. The common ground between these areas of research is that color appearance is tightly linked to the identification of objects and materials and the communication across observers. In conclusion, we argue that research should focus on how color processing is adapted to the surface properties of objects in the natural environment in order to bridge the gap between the known early stages of color perception and the subjective appearance of color.},

  abstract = {We present a full analysis of data from our preliminary report (Lafer-Sousa, Hermann, \& Conway, 2015) and test whether \#TheDress image is multistable. A multistable image must give rise to more than one mutually exclusive percept, typically within single individuals. Clustering algorithms of color-matching data showed that the dress was seen categorically, as white/gold (W/G) or blue/black (B/K), with a blue/brown transition state. Multinomial regression predicted categorical labels. Consistent with our prior hypothesis, W/G observers inferred a cool illuminant, whereas B/K observers inferred a warm illuminant; moreover, subjects could use skin color alone to infer the illuminant. The data provide some, albeit weak, support for our hypothesis that day larks see the dress as W/G and night owls see it as B/K. About half of observers who were previously familiar with the image reported switching categories at least once. Switching probability increased with professional art experience. Priming with an image that disambiguated the dress as B/K biased reports toward B/K (priming with W/G had negligible impact); furthermore, knowledge of the dress's true colors and any prior exposure to the image shifted the population toward B/K. These results show that some people have switched their perception of the dress. Finally, consistent with a role of attention and local image statistics in determining how multistable images are seen, we found that observers tended to discount as achromatic the dress component that they did not attend to: B/K reporters focused on a blue region, whereas W/G reporters focused on a golden region.},

  abstract = {Inferior temporal cortex (IT) is a key part of the ventral visual pathway implicated in object, face, and scene perception. But how does IT work? Here, I describe an organizational scheme that marries form and function and provides a framework for future research. The scheme consists of a series of stages arranged along the posterior-anterior axis of IT, defined by anatomical connections and functional responses. Each stage comprises a complement of subregions that have a systematic spatial relationship. The organization of each stage is governed by an eccentricity template, and corresponding eccentricity representations across stages are interconnected. Foveal representations take on a role in high-acuity object vision (including face recognition); intermediate representations compute other aspects of object vision such as behavioral valence (using color and surface cues); and peripheral representations encode information about scenes. This multistage, parallel-processing model invokes an innately determined organization refined by visual experience that is consistent with principles of cortical development. The model is also consistent with principles of evolution, which suggest that visual cortex expanded through replication of retinotopic areas. Finally, the model predicts that the most extensively studied network within IT-the face patches-is not unique but rather one manifestation of a canonical set of operations that reveal general principles of how IT works.},

  abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus is thought to represent color using two populations of cone-opponent neurons [L vs M; S vs (L + M)], which establish the cardinal directions in color space (reddish vs cyan; lavender vs lime). How is this representation transformed to bring about color perception? Prior work implicates populations of glob cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex (PIT; the V4 complex), but the correspondence between the neural representation of color in PIT/V4 complex and the organization of perceptual color space is unclear. We compared color-tuning data for populations of glob cells and interglob cells to predictions obtained using models that varied in the color-tuning narrowness of the cells, and the color preference distribution across the populations. Glob cells were best accounted for by simulated neurons that have nonlinear (narrow) tuning and, as a population, represent a color space designed to be perceptually uniform (CIELUV). Multidimensional scaling and representational similarity analyses showed that the color space representations in both glob and interglob populations were correlated with the organization of CIELUV space, but glob cells showed a stronger correlation. Hue could be classified invariant to luminance with high accuracy given glob responses and above-chance accuracy given interglob responses. Luminance could be read out invariant to changes in hue in both populations, but interglob cells tended to prefer stimuli having luminance contrast, regardless of hue, whereas glob cells typically retained hue tuning as luminance contrast was modulated. The combined luminance/hue sensitivity of glob cells is predicted for neurons that can distinguish two colors of the same hue at different luminance levels (orange/brown).},

Mantis shrimp have scanning compound eyes with 12 classes of photoreceptors, and have evolved a system to decode color information at the front-end of the sensory stream. Primates have image-focusing eyes with three classes of cones, and decode color further along the visual-processing hierarchy. Despite these differences, we report a fascinating parallel between the computational strategies at the color-decoding stage in the brains of stomatopods and primates. Both species appear to use narrowly tuned cells that support interval decoding color identification.},

To assess the organization of IT, we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in alert monkeys to achromatic images (faces, fruit, bodies and places) and colored gratings. IT contained multiple color-biased regions, which were typically ventral to face patches and yoked to them, spaced regularly at four locations predicted by known anatomy. Color and face selectivity increased for more anterior regions, indicative of a broad hierarchical arrangement. Responses to non-face shapes were found across IT, but were stronger outside color-biased regions and face patches, consistent with multiple parallel streams. IT also contained multiple coarse eccentricity maps: face patches overlapped central representations, color-biased regions spanned mid-peripheral representations and place-biased regions overlapped peripheral representations. These results show that IT comprises parallel, multi-stage processing networks subject to one organizing principle.},

We found this idea interesting but not thoroughly tested. In particular, tests on real images were limited to scenes made up artificially from hyperspectral data,4 spectral power distributions of various daylight illuminants, and the human cone sensitivity functions. The Ruderman database4 of hyperspectral images is also quite peculiar because it consists of a small number of images of mostly foliage. Our experiments show that for scenes composed from a more diversified hyperspectral database combined with real illuminant spectra, the predicted correlation turns out to be very weak. For actual digital camera images, the luminance-redness correlation fails completely.},

Many of these analyses could not have been done before simply because a large database for color constancy was not available. Our image database consists of approximately 11,000 images in which the RGB color of the ambient illuminant in each scene is measured. To build such a large database we used a novel set-up consisting of a digital video camera with a neutral gray sphere attached to the camera so that the sphere always appears in the field of view. Using a gray sphere instead of the standard gray card facilitates measurement of the variation in illumination as a function of incident angle. The study focuses on the analysis of the distribution of various illuminants in the natural scenes and the correlation between the rg-chromaticity of colors recorded by the camera and the rg-chromaticity of the ambient illuminant. We also investigate the possibility of improving the performance of the na{\"i}ve Gray World algorithm by considering a sequence of consecutive frames instead of a single image. The set of images is publicly available and can also be used as a database for testing color constancy algorithms.},

  abstract = {Methods: An instrument for reviewer evaluation was created in the form of a fictitious manuscript into which deliberate errors were placed in order to develop an approach for the analysis of peer reviewer performance. The manuscript described a doubleblind, placebo control study purportedly demonstrating that intravenous propranolol reduced the pain of acute migraine headache. There were 10 major and 13 minor errors placed in the manuscript. The work was distributed to all reviewers of Annals of Emergency Medicine for review.
Results: The manuscript was sent to 262 reviewers; 203 (78\%) reviews were returned. One-hundred ninety-nine reviewers recommended a disposition for the manuscript: 15 recommended acceptance, 117 rejection, and 67 revision. The 15 who recommended acceptance identified 17.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 11.3\% to 23.4\%) of the major and 11.8\% (CI 7.3\% to 16.3\%) of the minor errors. The 117 who recommended rejection identified 39.1\% (CI 36.3\% to 41.9\%) of the major and 25.2\% (CI 23.0\% to 27.4\%) of the minor errors. The 67 who recommended revision identified 29.6\% (CI 26.1\% to 33.1\%) of the major and 22.0\% (CI 19.3\% to 24.8\%) of the minor errors. The number of errors identified differed significantly across recommended disposition. Sixty-eight percent of the reviewers did not realize that the conclusions of the work were not supported by the results.
Conclusion: These data suggest that the use of a preconceived manuscript into which purposeful errors are placed may be a viable approach to evaluate reviewer performance.

Normalized cone excitations are calculated using the 10\textdegree{} Commission Internationale de l'{\'E}clairage (CIE) 2006 cone fundamentals. A von Kries chromatic adaptation transform applied in the CIE 2006 cone space is adopted, and luminance compression and adaptation due to the self-luminous background are included by using a Michaelis\textendash{}Menten function. Model parameters are determined by fitting the model to the experimental visual data obtained for brightness, hue, and the amount of color versus neutral. The model is validated with additional experimental data. An absolute brightness scale expressed in ``bright'' is proposed.},

  abstract = {Colour constancy is a skill by which people can tell the`colour of an object correctly, even when it is illuminated by strongly coloured lights. I derive the colour constancy equation, and obtain from this derivation the circumstances under which colour constancy is possible. I then employ the properties of surface reflectance functions to turn colour constancy into a parameter estimation problem. This leads in a natural way to two novel algorithms for colour constancy, distinguished by the assumptions required of the world for their success. The first, called Crule, succeeds on all surface reflectances under restrictions on the illuminant and corresponds to normalisation according to a coefficient rule. A physical realisability argument provides a strong constraint on the coefficients for this kind of normalisation. Within the region that satisfies this constraint, an estimator is used to select a set of coefficients for predicting colour appearance. The second algorithm, called Mwext, although a natural extension of recent work of Maloney and Wandell, is complex and restrictive in its requirements of the world. I show that these algorithms achieve colour constancy on real pictures. I show that this formalism is capable of reproducing qualitative aspects of Land's two colour experiments. I compare the Crule algorithm with a model of the Retinex algorithm of Land and show that the descriptors computed by the Crule algorithm are not as strongly dependent on the structure of the scene as those computed by the Retinex algorithm. Finally, I show that colour constancy can improve the quality of image segmentation, and is hence a useful and important technique for machine vision. A comprehensive review of the literature treating colour constancy in machine and human vision is provided.},

Unlike other ganglion cells, they depolarized in response to light even when all synaptic input from rods and cones was blocked. The sensitivity, spectral tuning, and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system.},

Seventeen observers used the method of limits to determine the neutral white locus and the most neutral white. The results showed that the neutral whites were located between -0.010 and -0.015 units below the Planckian locus.

  title = {A {{Retinal Mechanism Inspired Color Constancy Model}}},

  issn = {1057-7149},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel model for the computational color constancy, inspired by the amazing ability of the human vision system (HVS) to perceive the color of objects largely constant as the light source color changes. The proposed model imitates the color processing mechanisms in the specific level of the retina, the first stage of the HVS, from the adaptation emerging in the layers of cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) to the color-opponent mechanism and disinhibition effect of the non-classical receptive field in the layer of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In particular, HC modulation provides a global color correction with cone-specific lateral gain control, and the following RGCs refine the processing with iterative adaptation until all the three opponent channels reach their stable states (i.e., obtain stable outputs). Instead of explicitly estimating the scene illuminant(s), such as most existing algorithms, our model directly removes the effect of scene illuminant. Evaluations on four commonly used color constancy data sets show that the proposed model produces competitive results in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for the scenes under either single or multiple illuminants. The results indicate that single opponency, especially the disinhibitory effect emerging in the receptive field's subunit-structured surround of RGCs, plays an important role in removing scene illuminant(s) by inherently distinguishing the spatial structures of surfaces from extensive illuminant(s).},

We reevaluate the performance of six color constancy algorithms using the procedures that we set out and show that this leads to a significant change in the conclusions that we draw about relative algorithm performance as compared with those from previous work.},

  abstract = {Color constancy algorithms are often evaluated by using a distance measure that is based on mathematical principles, such as the angular error. However, it is unknown whether these distance measures correlate to human vision. Therefore, the main goal of our paper is to analyze the correlation between several performance measures and the quality, obtained by using psychophysical experiments, of the output images generated by various color constancy algorithms. Subsequent issues that are addressed are the distribution of performance measures, suggesting additional and alternative information that can be provided to summarize the performance over a large set of images, and the perceptual significance of obtained improvements, i.e., the improvement that should be obtained before the difference becomes noticeable to a human observer.},

  abstract = {Illumination estimation is an important component of color constancy and automatic white balancing. A number of methods of combining illumination estimates obtained from multiple subordinate illumination estimation methods now appear in the literature. These combinational methods aim to provide better illumination estimates by fusing the information embedded in the subordinate solutions. The existing combinational methods are surveyed and analyzed here with the goals of determining: 1) the effectiveness of fusing illumination estimates from multiple subordinate methods; 2) the best method of combination; 3) the underlying factors that affect the performance of a combinational method; and 4) the effectiveness of combination for illumination estimation in multiple-illuminant scenes. The various combinational methods are categorized in terms of whether or not they require supervised training and whether or not they rely on high-level scene content cues (e.g., indoor versus outdoor). Extensive tests and enhanced analyzes using three data sets of real-world images are conducted. For consistency in testing, the images were labeled according to their high-level features (3D stages, indoor/outdoor) and this label data is made available on-line. The tests reveal that the trained combinational methods (direct combination by support vector regression in particular) clearly outperform both the non-combinational methods and those combinational methods based on scene content cues.},

  abstract = {We present a physics-based approach for illuminant color estimation of arbitrary images, which is explicitly designed for handling images with multiple illuminants. The majority of techniques that extract the illuminant color assume that the illumination is constant across the scene. This, however, is not often the case. We propose an illuminant-color estimation method which is based on robust local illuminant estimates. There are no assumptions on the number or type of illuminants. An illuminant color estimate is obtained independently from distinct image mini-regions. From these mini-regions a robust local illumination color is computed by consensus. These local estimates are then used in deriving the chromaticity of the dominant illuminants. Experiments on an established benchmark database of real-world images show that our technique performs comparably to uniform-illuminant estimation methods. Furthermore, extensive tests on real-world images show that we can reliably process mixed illuminant scenes.},

Contrary to traditional methods, many researchers propose a variety of combinational color constancy methods through applying different color constancy mathematical models on an image simultaneously and then give out a final estimation in diverse ways. Although many comprehensive evaluations or reviews about color constancy methods are available, few focus on combinational strategies. In this paper, we survey some prevailing combinational strategies systematically; divide them into three categories and compare them qualitatively on three real-world image data sets in terms of the angular error and the perceptual Euclidean distance. The experimental results show that combinational strategies with training procedure always produces better performance.},

In this paper we propose a computational model which imitates the neural mechanisms of color information processing in retina. In this model we first compute a simple statistics of reflectance about the real scene by simulating bipolar cells. Then, the ganglion cells (e.g., the midget cells) receive both the computational statistics of reflectance of the scene from bipolar cells and the response from horizontal cells as well as amacrine cells. Subsequently, the ganglion cells provide a stable output independent of the color of illuminant. We tested our model on a commonly used large-scale linear image dataset, and the results demonstrate that our model provides better color constancy performance than those widely accepted color constancy models.},

  abstract = {The poor performance of the MaxRGB illuminationestimation method is often used in the literature as a foil when promoting some new illumination-estimation method. However, the results presented here show that in fact MaxRGB works surprisingly well when tested on a new dataset of 105 high dynamic range images, and also better than previously reported when some simple pre-processing is applied to the images of the standard 321 image set [1]. The HDR images in the dataset for color constancy research were constructed in the standard way from multiple exposures of the same scene. The color of the scene illumination was determined by photographing an extra HDR image of the scene with 4 Gretag Macbeth mini Colorcheckers at 45 degrees relative to one another placed in it. With preprocessing, MaxRGB's performance is statistically equivalent to that of Color by Correlation [2] and statistically superior to that of the Greyedge [3] algorithm on the 321 set (null hypothesis rejected at the 5\% significance level). It also performs as well as Greyedge on the HDR set. These results demonstrate that MaxRGB is far more effective than it has been reputed to be so long as it is applied to image data that encodes the full dynamic range of the original scene.},

However we noticed that this metric is not in line with how the illuminant estimates are used. Normally, the illuminant estimates are `divided out' from the image to, hopefully, provide image colors that are not confounded by the color of the light. However, even though the same reproduction results the same scene might have a large range of recovery errors. In this work the scale of the problem with the recovery error is quantified. Next we propose a new metric for evaluating illuminant estimation algorithms, called the reproduction angular error, which is defined as the angle between the RGB of a white surface when the actual and estimated illuminations are `divided out'. Our new metric ties algorithm performance to how the illuminant estimates are used. For a given algorithm, adopting the new reproduction angular error leads to different optimal parameters. Further the ranked list of best to worst algorithms changes when the reproduction angular is used. The importance of using an appropriate performance metric is established.},

Thus, we propose a novel framework for estimating the colors of multiple illuminants and their spatial distribution in the scene. We formulate this problem as an energy minimization task within a Conditional Random Field over a set of local illuminant estimates. In order to quantitatively evaluate the proposed method, we created a novel dataset of twodominant-illuminants images comprised of laboratory, indoor and outdoor scenes. Unlike prior work, our database includes accurate pixel-wise ground truth illuminant information. The performance of our method is evaluated on multiple datasets. Experimental results show that our framework clearly outperforms single illuminant estimators, as well as a recently proposed multi-illuminant estimation approach.},

The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods, a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method, a number of variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000) . We investigate the ability of these algorithms to make estimates of three different color constancy quantities: the chromaticity of the scene illuminant, the overall magnitude of that illuminant, and a corrected, illumination invariant, image. We consider algorithm performance as a function of the number of surfaces in scenes generated from reflectance spectra, the relative effect on the algorithms of added specularities, and the effect of subsequent clipping of the data.

  issn = {0091-3286, 1560-2303},
  abstract = {Spectrally tunable light sources for general lighting have recently attracted much attention as versatile solutions that can be used in humancentric lighting implementations provided with excellent color rendering and increased user perception. However, temperature and age-dependent color shifts and flux variations in the light-emitting diode (LED) emission are nonresolved challenges that need to be overcome in order to be used in final applications. We demonstrate two strategies that can be used to efficiently and precisely generate arbitrary spectral power distributions (SPDs) using multichannel LED engines. First, we introduce different methods to match a given SPD and select an algorithm (simulated annealing) in virtue of its speed (in the milliseconds range) and accuracy (color shifts {$\Delta$}u {${'}$} v {${'}$} {$<$} 5 \texttimes{} 10 - 4). Then, we propose a closed-loop feedback control (PID) to compensate for spectral shifts due to temperature changes or lumen decay of the LEDs. Both methods can be used independently, but only a combination of them (which uses the output of the first method as an initial guess for the second) offers fast computational times and high spectral accuracy and precision. Computation times are important because these algorithms are intended to be executed on dedicated microprocessors integrated in the LED modules, often sharing scarce memory and processing resources. The results presented here are aimed to be universal and hold for different implementations of the light engine and any number of LED channels.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Melanopsin photoreception plays a vital role in irradiance detection for non-image forming responses to light. However, little is known about the involvement of melanopsin in emotional processing of luminance. When confronted with a gradient in light, organisms exhibit spatial movements relative to this stimulus. In rodents, behavioural light aversion (BLA) is a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon during which animals attribute salience to light and remove themselves from it. Here, using genetically modified mice and an open field behavioural paradigm, we investigate the role of melanopsin in BLA. While wildtype (WT), melanopsin knockout (Opn4-/-) and rd/rd cl (melanopsin only (MO)) mice all exhibit BLA, our novel methodology reveals that isolated melanopsin photoreception produces a slow, potentiating response to light. In order to control for the involvement of pupillary constriction in BLA we eliminated this variable with topical atropine application. This manipulation enhanced BLA in WT and MO mice, but most remarkably, revealed light aversion in triple knockout (TKO) mice, lacking three elements deemed essential for conventional photoreception (Opn4-/- Gnat1-/- Cnga3-/-). Using a number of complementary strategies, we determined this response to be generated at the level of the retina. Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of how melanopsin signalling may modulate aversive responses to light in mice and humans. In addition, we also reveal a clear potential for light perception in TKO mice.},

  abstract = {In this work, the correlation between the perceived whiteness of lighting and the corresponding colour preference of observers was comprehensively investigated based on the data of 19 groups of experiments collected from 14 studies. The dataset included 13 experiments with constant correlated colour temperature and 6 experiments with multiple correlated colour temperatures, with illuminance levels ranging from 200\,lx to 500\,lx. For the five studies implemented by the authors, the subjective ratings of colour preference and the whiteness of lighting were acquired. For other cases, only the preference ratings were collected while the whiteness of lighting was quantified by a measure named degree of neutrality (Sneutral), which has been validated in our previous work. The meta-analysis results confirm our former statement that people prefer whiter illumination and further specify its prerequisite. That is, the whiteness of lighting generally correlates well with colour preference under the conditions where the candidate lights differed to a certain extent in white. In addition, it was further demonstrated that for the scenarios with multiple correlated colour temperatures ranging from 2500\,K to 5500\,K people indeed preferred perceptually whiter light chromaticities, while for correlated colour temperatures higher than 5500\,K it seemed that they appeared too cold to be preferred.},

  issn = {1878-5646},
  abstract = {Adaptation to environmental light allows our visual system to compensate for dynamic changes in the visual environment for avoiding everyday hazards (e.g., misreading traffic lights) and for accurate reaching. We investigated the hypothesis that adaptation to coloured light is achieved not only via photoreceptors in the retina and monocular contrast adaptation, but also by a binocular process that may occur at the level of the cerebral cortex. In the present study, to determine the role of higher-order cortical binocular processes in adaptation to coloured light, participants were adapted to chromatic light such that the duration of adaptation during monocular processing differed from that during binocular processing. A dichoptic device was used to adapt each eye independently. The extent of after-effects, measured as the distance between the neutral points before and after adaptation to coloured light, depended on the duration of adaptation not only at the monocular level but also at a higher cortical level downstream from binocular fusion. Thus, contrast adaptation to coloured light occurs on at least two levels; it is a result of monocular processes at one level and binocular processes at the other, and each type of process exhibits different temporal characteristics. The results of this study suggest a significant cortical role in adaptation to changes in lighting conditions or the optical environment, including the effects of age on the eye, and the necessity of further investigation to clarify the functional connection between chromatic adaptation by photo-receptors and chromatic adaptation by cortical systems.},

We employed Barten's mechanistic model and adapted it for contextual modeling purposes by postulating that, signal detection in a given frequency band, when presented amongst other broadband signals, can be modeled as if amongst noise. We found that the iCSF varies with pictorial content, but that the standard CSF model and the image's contrast spectrums are sufficient to predict with relative success the cCSF for any given image. We finally discuss the suitability of cCSF models in image quality modeling.},

We ask whether such a process can account for the appearance of extended colour fields in natural images. Some form of colour filling-in must underlie the equiluminant colour Craik\textendash{}O'Brien\textendash{}Cornsweet effect and the Watercolour Effect, but these effects are too weak to account for the appearance of extended colour fields in natural images. Moreover, the graded colour disappearance effect reported as evidence for colour filling-in does not work under natural viewing conditions. We demonstrate that natural images do not look very colourful when their colour is restricted to edge transitions. Moreover, purely chromatic images with maximally graded (edgeless) transitions look fully colourful. Consequently, we conclude that colour filling-in makes no more than a minor contribution to the appearance of extended colour regions in natural images.},

The concept relates the numerical value to a visual observation of smallest colour difference between the chromaticity of the test source and of a point lying on the Planckian locus. In practice, chromaticity difference on a uniform chromaticity scale diagram is used. Since the introduction of the CIELUV and CIELAB spaces, it has been questioned whether the calculations should be done on the traditional u,v diagram, or by using a more equidistant colour space. Based on our visual experiments, we can state that the u,v diagram-based calculation is adequate to describe the correlated colour temperature of a source. The individual scatter of observations is so large that a visual definition has no practical reality. Thus, we recommend changing the definition of correlated colour temperature from a visual definition to a mathematical one and dropping any reference to visual investigations. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  volume = {27},
  issn = {09609822},
  abstract = {A direct retinal projection targets the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (an important hypothalamic control center). The accepted function of this projection is to convey information about ambient light (irradiance) to synchronize the SCN's endogenous circadian clock with local time and drive the diurnal variations in physiology and behavior [1\textendash{}4]. Here, we report that it also renders the SCN responsive to visual images. We map spatial receptive fields (RFs) for SCN neurons and find that only a minority are excited (or inhibited) by light from across the scene as expected for irradiance detectors. The most commonly encountered units have RFs with small excitatory centers, combined with very extensive inhibitory surrounds that reduce their sensitivity to global changes in light in favor of responses to spatial patterns. Other units have larger excitatory RF centers, but these always cover a coherent region of visual space, implying visuotopic order at the single-unit level. Approximately 75\% of light-responsive SCN units modulate their firing according to simple spatial patterns (drifting or inverting gratings) without changes in irradiance. The time-averaged firing rate of the SCN is modestly increased under these conditions, but including spatial contrast did not significantly alter the circadian phase resetting efficiency of light. Our data indicate that the SCN contains information about irradiance and spatial patterns. This newly appreciated sensory capacity provides a mechanism by which behavioral and physiological systems downstream of the SCN could respond to visual images [5].},

  abstract = {The evolution of terrestrial vertebrates, starting around 385 million years ago, is an iconic moment in evolution that brings to mind images of fish transforming into four-legged animals. Here, we show that this radical change in body shape was preceded by an equally dramatic change in sensory abilities akin to transitioning from seeing over short distances in a dense fog to seeing over long distances on a clear day. Measurements of eye sockets and simulations of their evolution show that eyes nearly tripled in size just before vertebrates began living on land. Computational simulations of these animal's visual ecology show that for viewing objects through water, the increase in eye size provided a negligible increase in performance. However, when viewing objects through air, the increase in eye size provided a large increase in performance. The jump in eye size was, therefore, unlikely to have arisen for seeing through water and instead points to an unexpected hybrid of seeing through air while still primarily inhabiting water. Our results and several anatomical innovations arising at the same time suggest lifestyle similarity to crocodiles. The consequent combination of the increase in eye size and vision through air would have conferred a 1 million-fold increase in the amount of space within which objects could be seen. The ``buena vista'' hypothesis that our data suggest is that seeing opportunities from afar played a role in the subsequent evolution of fully terrestrial limbs as well as the emergence of elaborated action sequences through planning circuits in the nervous system.},

  title = {Colour {{Correction Toolbox}}},
  abstract = {For a camera image, the RGB response from the imaging sensor cannot be used to drive display devices directly. The reason behind this is two-fold: different cameras have different spectral sensitivities, and there are different target output spaces (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, and XYZ). The process of mapping from captured RGBs to an output colour space is called colour correction. Colour Correction is of interest in its own right (e.g. for colour measurement), but it is also an important part of the colour processing pipelines found in digital cameras. In this paper, we look at the problem of mapping device RGB values to corresponding CIE XYZ tristimuli. We make three contributions. First, we review and implement a range of colour correction algorithms. We benchmark these algorithms in experiments using both synthetic data (so we can numerically assess a wider range of cameras) and real image data.

  abstract = {We investigated how well seven saturation measures defined in CIECAM02, HSV, DKL, LAB, LUV, and CIE 1931 xyY color spaces correspond to human perception of saturation. We used a paradigm that allowed us to measure the perceived saturation of several standard color stimuli in many different directions of color space. We implemented this paradigm at different levels of luminance and varied background luminance relative to the luminance of our color stimuli in order to ensure the generality of our approach. We found that varying background luminance changed the relative saturation of the standard colors. Raising the overall luminance level did not have such an effect. We compared the results of our measurements to the predictions of the seven saturation measures. All of the measures could predict our observers' judgments of saturation reasonably well. The measures that are based on measurements of discrimination thresholds (LUV, LAB, CIECAM02) performed best on average. However, some of the perceptual effects induced by changing background luminance could not be predicted by any measure.},

  abstract = {Color constancy algorithms are generally based on the simplifying assumption that the spectral distribution of a light source is uniform across scenes. However, in reality, this assumption is often violated due to the presence of multiple light sources. In this paper, we will address more realistic scenarios where the uniform light-source assumption is too restrictive. First, a methodology is proposed to extend existing algorithms by applying color constancy locally to image patches, rather than globally to the entire image. After local (patch-based) illuminant estimation, these estimates are combined into more robust estimations, and a local correction is applied based on a modified diagonal model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on spectral and real images show that the proposed methodology reduces the influence of two light sources simultaneously present in one scene. If the chromatic difference between these two illuminants is more than 1\textdegree, the proposed framework outperforms algorithms based on the uniform light-source assumption (with error-reduction up to approximately 30\%). Otherwise, when the chromatic difference is less than 1\textdegree{}and the scene can be considered to contain one (approximately) uniform light source, the performance of the proposed method framework is similar to global color constancy methods.},

Many illuminant estimation solutions have been proposed in the last few years, although it is known that the problem addressed is actually ill-posed as its solution lacks uniqueness and stability. To cope with this problem, different solutions usually exploit some assumptions about the statistical properties of the expected illuminants and/or of the object reflectances in the scene. In this keynote we briefly review state of the art methods and illustrate our recent research on classification-based color constancy, where automatically extracted low level features are used to drive the selection and combination of the best algorithm(s) for each image.

There are statistics-based and learning-based computational color constancy methods and the latter ones are known to be more accurate.

Reflectance reconstruction from multispectral image data is typically based on certain assumptions. One of the common assumptions is that the same illumination is used for system calibration and image acquisition. The authors propose the concept of multispectral constancy which transforms the captured sensor data into an illuminant-independent representation, analogously to the concept of computational color constancy. They propose to transform the multispectral image data to a canonical representation through spectral adaptation transform (SAT). The performance of such a transform is tested on measured reflectance spectra and hyperspectral reflectance images. The authors also investigate the robustness of the transform to the inaccuracy of illuminant estimation in natural scenes. Results of reflectance reconstruction show that the proposed SAT is efficient and is robust to error in illuminant estimation. c 2018 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.},

  abstract = {Colour cast is the ambient presence of unwanted colour in digital images due to the source illuminant while colour constancy is the ability to perceive colors of object, invariant to the colour of the source illuminant. Existing statistic based colour constancy methods use whole image pixel values for illuminant estimation. However, not every region of an image contains reliable colour information. Therefore, the presence of large uniform colour patches within the image considerably deteriorates the performance of colour constancy algorithms. This paper presents an algorithm to alleviate the biasing effect of the uniform colour patches of the colour constancy compensation techniques. It employs the k-means clustering algorithm to segment image areas according to their colour information. The Average Absolute Difference (AAD) of each colour component of the segment is calculated and used to identify and exclude segments with uniform colour information from being used for colour constancy adjustments. Experimental results were generated using three benchmark datasets and compared with the state of the art techniques. Results show the proposed technique outperforms existing techniques in the presence of the uniform colour patches and similar to Grey World method in the absent o uniform colour patches.},

For much of the development of computer vision greyscale images were all that was available and so techniques were developed for that medium. Equally, if a problem can be solved in greyscale - and many can be - then the added complexity of starting with 3 image planes as oppose to 1 is not needed. But, truthfully, colour is not used ubiquitously as there are some important concepts that need to be understood if colour is to be used correctly. In this chapter I summarise the basic model of colour image formation which teaches that the colours recorded by a camera depend equally on the colour of the prevailing light and the colour of objects in the scene. Building on this, some of the fundamental ideas of colorimetry are discussed in the context of colour correction: the process whereby acquired camera RGBs are mapped to the actual RGBs used to drive a display. Then, we discuss how we can remove colour bias due to illumination. Two methods are presented: we can solve for the colour of the light (colour constancy) or remove it through algebraic manipulation (illuminant invariance). Either approach is necessary if colour is to be used as a descriptor for problems such as recognition and tracking. The chapter also touches on aspects of human perception.},

A well-known color constancy method is based on the gray-world assumption which assumes that the average reflectance of surfaces in the world is achromatic. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis for color constancy namely the gray-edge hypothesis, which assumes that the average edge difference in a scene is achromatic. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Contrary to existing color constancy algorithms, which are computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the derivative structure of images. Furthermore, we propose a framework which unifies a variety of known (gray-world, max-RGB, Minkowski norm) and the newly proposed gray-edge and higher order gray-edge algorithms. The quality of the various instantiations of the framework is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art color constancy methods on two large data sets of images recording objects under a large number of different light sources. The experiments show that the proposed color constancy algorithms obtain comparable results as the state-of-the-art color constancy methods with the merit of being computationally more efficient.},

  abstract = {In illuminant estimation, we attempt to estimate the RGB of the light. We then use this estimate on an image to correct for the light's colour bias. Illuminant estimation is an essential component of all camera reproduction pipelines. How well an illuminant estimation algorithm works is determined by how well it predicts the ground truth illuminant colour. Typically, the ground truth is the RGB of a white surface placed in a scene. Over a large set of images an estimation error is calculated and different algorithms are then ranked according to their average estimation performance. Perhaps the most widely used publically available dataset used in illuminant estimation is Gehler's Colour Checker set that was reprocessed by Shi and Funt. This image set comprises 568 images of typical everyday scenes.},

  title = {Illuminant Estimation Using Constrained {{Minkowski}} Norms},
  abstract = {Colour constancy algorithms attempt to estimate and then remove the colour of the prevailing illuminant. Since, only when this is done, can image colour be used as a cue for reflectance and so usefully subserve tasks such as tracking and recognition. Broadly speaking, there are two ways to estimate the illuminant. First, we might calculate a simple statistic, such as the mean, from the image and argue that this should correlate with light colour. Second, we incorporate physical knowledge and probabilistic inference to arrive at the estimate. The latter approach results in significantly better performance though, often at significant computational cost. In this paper we present a simple statistical approach which, given only knowledge of the RGBs of typical lights, results in performance close to that delivered by more complex algorithms. The paper begins with the observation that the two simplest statistical estimators, the mean and max RGB responses, are respectively the L1 and L{$\infty$} norms. We show then that an LP norm might also be used as an estimator. The theory is then developed to allow a prior constraint to be placed on the illuminant (natural and artificial lights are often bluish, whitish and yellowish but are rarely purple). Experiments on the Simon Fraser calibrated data set show that the illuminant can be reliably estimated using a constrained L4 norm. Moreover, performance is comparable to the most advanced methods.},

  title = {Human Visual Processing: Beyond 3 Sensors},
  shorttitle = {Human Visual Processing},
  abstract = {Much of image processing and vision uses 3 sensors because we ourselves have trichromatic vision. However, some solutions to vision problems use additional hardware not available to ourselves in order to get the best performance. For example, the idea of placing a coloured filter in front of a vision system, and capturing two images: one with-and another one without the filter has recently been revisited in the context of the illumination estimation problem. It was shown that the plus-filter illuminant estimation is easier to solve and so it is easier to estimate and discount illumination compared with traditional methods. In this paper we propose that this two image approach is in fact plausible for human visual processing. Indeed, a little known and little explained optical fact is that the light striking the central part of the retina is pre-filtered with a yellow filter (the macular pigment) but no pre-filtering occurs to light striking other parts of the retina. Since the world we see is a composite of several images taken at different fixation points we argue that the visual system in principle has access to two images: normal RGBs + RGBs measured through a yellow filter. Experiments demonstrate that the illumination estimation performance that is possible starting with the human vision system sensitivities is excellent and as for machine vision is much better than the non plus-filter algorithms. We discuss the wider relevance of this result to the vision and imaging community.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Under typical daytime light levels, the human pupillary light response (PLR) is driven by the activity of the L, M, and S cones, and melanopsin expressed in the so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, the importance of each of these photoreceptive mechanisms in defining pupil size under real-world viewing conditions remains to be established. To address this question, we embedded photoreceptor-specific modulations in a movie displayed using a novel projector-based five-primary spatial stimulation system, which allowed for the precise control of photoreceptor activations in time and space. We measured the pupillary light response in eleven observers, who viewed short cartoon movies which contained hidden low-frequency (0.25 Hz) silent-substitution modulations of the L, M and S cones (no stimulation of melanopsin), melanopsin (no stimulation of L, M and S cones), both L, M, and S cones and melanopsin or no modulation at all. We find that all photoreceptors active at photopic light levels regulate pupil size under this condition. Our data imply that embedding modulations in photoreceptor contrast could provide a method to manipulate key adaptive aspects of the human visual system in everyday, real-world activities such as watching a movie.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The replicability and consistency of findings concerning colour\textendash{}shape correspondences are examined in three online colour\textendash{}shape matching experiments using the same procedure and study design while varying the sets of shape stimuli that are evaluated. Participants matched one of 36 colours to each shape as well as made preference and arousal appraisal ratings for each of the shapes and colours. The complexities of analysing colour\textendash{}shape correspondence data are discussed and illustrated by classifying and analysing shape and colours in a variety of different ways, including using continuous perceptual and objective measures. Significant colour\textendash{}shape associations were found. However, as hypothesised, limited consistent results in regard to what perceptual shape characteristics predicted colour choices were documented across the three stimuli sets. This was the case both within and across different analysis methods. The factors that may be responsible for these inconsistencies are critically discussed. Intriguingly, however, evidence for emotional mediation, whereby shape and colour liking and arousal appraisals appear to influence the colour\textendash{}shape correspondences made by participants, was found across all three experiments.},

Under neutral-adapting conditions, we mapped the cone inputs (L, M, and S) to 83 cone-opponent cells representing the central visual field of the next stage of visual processing, primary visual cortex (V1), to determine how the color signals are spatially transformed. Cone-opponent cells, constituting {$\sim$}10\% of V1 cells, formed two populations, red\textendash{}green (L vs M; 66 of 83) and blue\textendash{}yellow (S vs L+M; 17 of 83). Many cone-opponent cells (48 of 83) were double-opponent, with circular receptive-field centers and crescent-shaped surrounds (0.63\textdegree{} offset) that had opposite chromatic tuning to the centers and a time-to-peak 11 ms later than the centers. The remaining cone-opponent cells were either spatially opponent in only one cone system (20 of 83) or lacked spatial opponency (15 of 83). Cells lacking spatial opponency had smaller receptive fields (0.5\textendash{}0.7\textdegree{}) than spatial-opponent cell centers ({$\sim$}1\textdegree{}). We found that red\textendash{}green cells received S-cone input, which aligned with M input, and, unlike blue\textendash{}yellow cells, red\textendash{}green cells gave push\textendash{}pull responses: receptive-field centers of red-ON cells were excited by both L increments (bright red) and M decrements (dark red) and were suppressed by both L decrements (dark green) and M increments (bright green). Excitatory responses to decrements were slightly larger than to increments, which may account for the lower detection and discrimination thresholds of decrements shown psychophysically. By virtue of their specialized receptive fields, the neurons described here spatially transform the cone signals and represent the first stage in the visual system at which spatially opponent color calculations are made.},

  abstract = {Summary
Imaging studies are consistent with the existence of brain regions specialized for color, but electrophysiological studies have produced conflicting results. Here we address the neural basis for color, using targeted single-unit recording in alert macaque monkeys, guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same subjects. Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, PITd, and posterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call ``globs,'' each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity. Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in ``interglob'' regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective. These results suggest that color perception is mediated by specialized neurons that are clustered within the extrastriate brain.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}It is easier to read dark text on a bright background (positive polarity) than to read bright text on a dark background (negative polarity). This positive-polarity advantage is often linked to pupil size: A bright background induces small pupils, which in turn increases visual acuity. Here we report that pupil size, when manipulated through peripheral brightness, has qualitatively different effects on discrimination of fine stimuli in central vision and detection of faint stimuli in peripheral vision. Small pupils lead to improved discrimination performance, consistent with the positive-polarity advantage, but only for very small stimuli that are at the threshold of visual acuity. In contrast, large pupils lead to improved detection performance. These results are likely due to two pupil-size related factors: Small pupils increase visual acuity, which improves discrimination of fine stimuli; and large pupils increase light influx, which improves detection of faint stimuli. Light scatter is likely also a contributing factor: When a display is bright, light scatter creates a diffuse veil of retinal illumination that reduces image contrast, thus impairing detection performance. We further found that pupil size was larger during the detection task than during the discrimination task, even though both tasks were equally difficult and similar in visual input; this suggests that the pupil may automatically assume an optimal size for the current task. Our results may explain why pupils dilate in response to arousal: This may reflect an increased emphasis on detection of unpredictable danger, which is crucially important in many situations that are characterized by high levels of arousal. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the ergonomics of display design.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this illusion, the mortar lines are misperceived as diverging or converging rather than horizontal. We examine the capability of a simple bioplausible filtering model to recognize different degrees of tilt effect in the Cafe Wall illusion based on different characteristics of the pattern. Our study employed a Difference of Gaussians model of retinal to cortical ON center and/or OFF center receptive fields. A wide range of parameters of the stimulus, for example mortar thickness, luminance, tiles contrast, phase of the tile displacement, have been studied. Our model constructs an edge map representation at multiple scales that reveals tilt cues and clues involved in the illusory perception of the Cafe Wall pattern. We present here that our model can not only detect the tilt in this pattern, but also can predict the strength of the illusion and quantify the degree of tilt. For the first time quantitative predictions of a model are reported for this stimulus. The results of our simulations are consistent with previous psychophysical findings across the full range of Cafe Wall variations tested. Our results also suggest that the Difference of Gaussians mechanism is the heart of the effects explained by, and the mechanisms proposed for, the Irradiation, Brightness Induction, and Bandpass Filtering models.},

We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Horne and Ostberg's questionnaire to ascertain aspects of sleep quality and CT and Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) and the Lanthony Desaturated D-15 Test (D-15d) to verify the color perception. Significant difference was found in the PSQI (F(2.20) = 15.77, p p p p p p {$<$} .001). The chromatic confusion axes will vary according to the synchronization of daily variation and the EM typology has higher chromatic sensitivity, pointing to a possible relation between visual circadian filters and spatial chromatic information. The daily fluctuation of visual sensitivity may explain the preliminary results on the circadian effects on color perception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Color processing and especially color constancy performs an important role in computer vision and image processing applications such as image retrieval, image classification, color object recognition, and object tracking. Color constancy is usually understood as the task of finding descriptors which are invariant to illumination changes in surfaces of a scene while correcting colors in an image is considered as a different phase. This paper proposes a new combinational method based on fuzzy method and clustering to estimate the chromaticity of the light source as the major step of color constancy. In this algorithm, after fuzzification different features of the image by using a clustering algorithm estimates the light source illuminant. To verify the proposed method, four well-known algorithms were selected based on the best algorithm by the proposed approach. In selecting these methods, it was tried to choose the ones which had better performance in comparison to other methods. It is shown in this article that the proposed approach performs better than other proposed methods for color constancy most of the time.},

  abstract = {In the retina, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) which express photopigment melanopsin have been identified as photoreceptors which differ from cones and rods. It has been established that such melanopsin-expressing RGCs are involved in the circadian photo-entrainment and pupillary light reflexes. An additional projection from ipRGCs to the lateral geniculate nucleus has been identified, which indicates the association of ipRGCs with visual perception induced by the image-forming pathway. Reportedly, ipRGCs modulate brightness perception but quantitative analysis of brightness perception involving melanopsin and cones-based signals has not been elucidated. We conducted brightness perception experiments that involved melanopsin using a novel projector with six primary colors and formulated the results for melanopsin and cone stimuli. The white visual stimuli (5 degrees in size) that we used had a single xy-chromaticity values but melanopsin stimuli were modulated by designing different spectral distributions. Perceived brightness was measured using a magnitude estimation method at several luminance levels in the near periphery (7 degrees). Additionally, pupil diameter was measured for estimating the intensity of visual stimuli on the retina. The results showed that the perceived brightness of a white visual stimulus with different spectral distributions can be described by a summation of the nearly linear melanopsin response and the non-linear cone response with weighted coefficients, and the contribution ratio of melanopsin in brightness perception increased to 50\% and more with increasing visual stimulus. These suggest that melanopsin signals play a crucial role in the estimation of the absolute intensity of the light environment by obtaining absolute brightness information even when cones are adapted by light.},

  abstract = {Spectral and 3D imaging techniques are used for museum imaging and cultural heritage documentation providing complementary information to aid in documenting the condition, informing the care, and increasing our understanding of objects. Specialised devices for spectral and 3D imaging may not be accessible for many heritage institutions, due to cost and complexity, and the modification of a consumer digital camera presents the potential of an accessible scientific tool for 2D and 3D spectral imaging. Consumer digital cameras are optimised for visible light, colour photography, but the underlying sensor is inherently sensitive to near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared radiation. This research presents the characterisation of a modified camera to investigate the impact of the modification on the spectroradiometric and geometric image quality with the intention of the device being used as a scientific tool for cultural heritage documentation. The characterisation includes the assessment of 2D image quality looking at visual noise, sharpness, and sampling efficiency using the target and software associated with the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative. Results suggest that these modifications give rise to discrepancies in computed surface geometries of the order of {$\pm$} 0.1 mm for small to medium sized objects used in the study and recorded in the round (maximum dimension 20 cm). Measuring the spectral response quantifies the modified camera as a scientific device for more accurate measurements and provides indications of wavelengths that could improve documentation based on sensitivity. The modification of a consumer digital camera provides a less expensive, high-resolution option for 2D and 3D spectral imaging.},

On the other hand, there are big differences in the amount of the macular pigment in different eyes and probably some variation in its dominant hue. These variations have been investigated by matches on a standard white, results for 36 observers being given in the paper and a mean value determined, This value, combined with the mean spectral coefficients, has been used to compute an average locus for the spectral colours in the colour triangle, with white at the centre.},

  abstract = {Recent publications in the Journal of Biological Rhythms have focused on the hypothesis that the property of melanopsin bistability is functionally translated to in vivo mammalian physiology. Physiological consequences of photopigment bistability likely can be inferred from the more extensive invertebrate literature. In invertebrates, photopigment bistability results in (a) photoreceptor independence from specialized chromophore regenerating systems, (b) long-wavelength enhancement of a blue light effect, (c) expression of a prolonged depolarization afterpotential following intense blue light stimulation, and (d) photopigment endocytosis following chronic short-wavelength light exposure. If analogous physiological phenomena result from melanopsin bistability in mammals, then one can take advantage of the spectral composition of a light source to modulate its impact on photoentrainment and other light-dependent circadian phenomena. In any event, investigators studying phenomena that are affected by photic stimulation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells should detail the spectral composition of their light sources before, during, and after an experimental photic stimulus.},

Researchers \textendash{} often implicitly \textendash{} assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species \textendash{} frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior \textendash{} hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity.

  title = {A Method for Performing Colour Constancy Studies Using a Tablet Computer},
  abstract = {Presented at ECVP 2017, Berlin.{$<$}br{$>$}Abstract:A method for
exploring colour constancy in real world environments has been developed, which
uses a handheld tablet computer and successive presentation of isoluminant
planes through CIELUV space, varying in spatial offset and orientation. The
observer was required to select an achromatic point within each stimulus, and
from their selection an estimation of their state of chromatic adaptation was
acquired.{$<$}br{$>$}

Aside from being
suitable for real world environments, the technique may also be valuable as a
method for assessing colour constancy quickly in large numbers of members of
the public and, also due to the simplicity of the task and the familiarity of
the apparatus, it allows for a broader demographic range of observers than are
generally available for such experiments.

At AIC 2016 preliminary
data was presented (Garside et. al, AIC 2016) based on experiments in the Grant
Museum of Zoology where this technique was originally trialled, with the aim of
understanding inherent observer variability, and deciding upon a recommended
number of repeats for such an experiment. The derived number of repeats was 30,
but it was decided that an environment with more constant and controlled
lighting was required to more fully understand inter-observer variability.

Here, two new data
sets will be considered; the first collected at various locations within the
British Museum, with the aim of more comprehensively exploring inter-observer
variability; and the second collected in the controlled environment of the
PAMELA research laboratory at UCL, where the acuity of this system, and
inter-observer variability was explored.},

  abstract = {In order to find out appropriate lighting levels to create safe nighttime street environments, the nature of the relationships between pedestrian behaviour and lighting (illuminance) levels was explored using the PAMELA facility at University College London. The behaviour examined was the avoidance of collision with another pedestrian or an obstacle, and the facial recognition distance and the interpersonal distance required to feel comfortably secure. A pilot experiment was set up, in which the behaviour of ten participants was tested under illuminance of 0.67, 2.8, 5.5, 12.3 and 627 lux. Results showed that only facial recognition distance has a proportionate relationship to the illuminance levels. It was also found that in order to provide facial recognition when a pedestrian starts a collision avoidance manoeuvre, more illuminance than today's lighting standard is necessary. It is suggested to reconsider what tasks are necessary for pedestrians at nighttime, and that the illuminance level of each street should be based on assumed tasks undertaken by pedestrians, rather than car traffic, on each street.},

  abstract = {The relationships between environmental features and older people's ability to safely move around a complex pedestrian environment are, as yet, poorly understood. Specifically, the impact of light levels on trip hazard detection during walking has received relatively little attention. This study investigates the effect of illuminance on people's ability to detect steps of different heights in a laboratory-based controlled environment. Sixteen young and 15 older participants walked along a 13.2\,m walkway towards an either ascending or descending step at 200 lux or 4 lux light levels. Trial time, gaze behaviour and distance at which the step was first visually fixated (detection distance) were measured using an eye-tracker. It was found that both the trial time and detection distance of older participants were affected by light level whereas the fixation number and fixation duration of young participants were affected by step-height. Shorter detection distance, greater number of fixations and longer fixation duration were found among older participants as opposed to young participants. The results suggest that the processing efficiency for visual information on an upcoming step is slower among older people than among young people. This implies that the vulnerability of older pedestrians maybe be reduced if better lighting or a simplified visual environment is provided.},

  shorttitle = {Raincloud Plots},
  abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired `inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These ``raincloud plots'' can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (

  issn = {0042-6989},
  abstract = {Under different ordinary qualities of illumination, a given surface retains its chromatic appearance nearly undisturbed after the observer becomes adapted to the change in quality, although the visual stimuli may be quite different for the diverse qualities. This phenomenon, called ``chromatic adaptation'', is customarily assumed to be equivalent to a proportional attenuation of responses that are linearly related to the physical stimuli. Analyses of data obtained recently by three independent experimenters using very different procedures indicate, however, that the hypothesis of a linear relation between the response and the stimulus fails systematically to account for the experimental results within reasonable limits of error. By combining the hypothesis of proportional attenuation and of various nonlinear relations between response and stimulus, most of the systematic errors in accounting for the experimental results can be eliminated. The most successful forms of the nonlinearities associated with the three color-receptor systems in various states of chromatic adaptation are found to be rather similar for the data of all three experiments. In general, the form of the nonlinearity thus deduced is different for each of the three color-receptor systems and, for each, is differently dependent upon the state of chromatic adaptation.

There is almost no function in the human body which is not affected by lead toxicity. Though in countries like US and Canada the use of lead has been controlled up to a certain extent, it is still used vehemently in the developing countries. This is primarily because lead bears unique physical and chemical properties that make it suitable for a large number of applications for which humans have exploited its benefits from historical times and thus it has become a common environmental pollutant. Lead is highly persistent in the environment and because of its continuous use its levels rise in almost every country, posing serious threats. This article reviews the works listed in the literature with recent updates regarding the toxicity of lead. Focus is also on toxic effects of lead on the renal, reproductive and nervous system. Finally the techniques available for treating lead toxicity are presented with some recent updates.},

Here, commercially available LEDs and real objects, instead of theoretical spectra and test sample colors, are investigated. Simulations show that energy savings of up to 15\% are possible when illuminating common objects with mixtures of narrowband LEDs, compared to illumination by reference phosphor-coated white LEDs, without inducing changes in color appearance. Experiments show that higher energy savings are achievable without degrading object appearance. Object optical properties impact the success of this approach.},

  title = {Damage Functions in Heritage Science},
  volume = {58},
  issn = {0039-3630},
  abstract = {This contribution critically examines various concepts related to damage functions in current use; it does not represent a comprehensive review, however. In heritage science, damage functions can be defined as functions of unacceptable change, dependent on agents of change. Unlike in other domains of science, the reference to unacceptable change implies that a value-based decision needs to be applied to the analytically determinable change, or dose\textendash{}response function. Since there are a number of values associated with heritage, there can be a number of damage functions describing one and the same physical or chemical process of change. For practical reasons, it is thus useful to decouple the value function from the dose\textendash{}response function, as the latter can be independently deduced (empirically or experimentally). While the behaviour of single materials and objects is often modelled deterministically, the probabilistic approach can be used to describe the degradation of complex structures, e.g. buildings, although not commonly in heritage research. There is a case to be made for more in-depth exploration of incremental and stochastic processes of degradation of heritage materials and structures, and the associated values, with a view towards developing more damage functions. Damage functions find use in modelling for predictive maintenance. However, predictions are associated with uncertainty due to the need for extrapolation, and this is also rarely analytically examined. Validation of modelling processes is possible using accurate methodologies of asset monitoring, which would enable an effective appraisal of preservation strategies.},

The analysis on solar radiation data and models showed that the current climate files under-estimate all irradiance components, whereas a combination of Met Office data and the Skartveit separation model can drastically improve irradiance estimates. The use of this improved model to derive irradiance values led to a significant improvement in the reliability of CBDM results as well.},

A set of artificial spectral reflectance generated from this physical model showed very similar characteristics of the Munsell data set, and the reverse of the model can also give accurately reconstruction of the original reflectance spectra.},

Whereas a great deal of work has been carried out to address which characterization method gives the best performance, rather less work has been carried out to investigate which characterization target is optimum for the characterization process. This paper describes methods to select optimum colors from a large data set of 1269 Munsell colors.

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used to reconstruct the spectral reflectance of surface colors. However, the estimated spectral accuracy is low when using only one set of three principal components for three-channel color-acquisition devices. In this study, the spectral space was first divided into 11 subgroups, and the principal components were calculated for individual subgroups. Then the principal components were further extended from three to nine through the residual spectral error of the reflectance in each subgroup. For each target sample, the extended principal components of the corresponding subgroup samples were used in the common PCA method to reconstruct the spectral reflectance. The results show that this proposed method is quite accurate and outperforms other related methods.},

  abstract = {The classical principal component analysis technique is enhanced for reconstruction of reflectance spectra of surface colors from the corresponding tristimulus values under a given set of viewing conditions, i.e., D65 illuminant and 1964 standard observer. In this paper, the number of implemented eigenvectors has been virtually extended from three to six by estimation of another set of tristimulus values under illuminant A and 1964 standard observer. The second set of colorimetric data was predicted by the conventional non-linear regression method and used in the spectral reconstruction to produce a fully determined system in the case of six eigenvectors. The improvement obtained from the proposed modification was examined for the recovery of the reflectance spectra of Munsell color chips as well as ColorChecker DC samples. The performance is evaluated by the mean, maximum and standard deviation of color difference values under other sets of light sources. The values of mean, maximum and standard deviation of root mean square (RMS) errors between the reproduced and the actual spectra were also calculated. Results are compared with those obtained from traditional methods using the principal component analysis (PCA) routine. All metrics show that the suggested method leads to considerable improvements in comparison with the standard PCA approach.},

Such an expansion is most tractable in color technology applications when it is homogenous. However, more often a true principal-component analysis (PCA) is performed, which involves an offset of the expansion by a mean spectrum. In deference to custom, we discuss and exercise the traditional PCA on reflectances. We review the method of calculation and present tables of the principal components of 3,534 object-color samples from three color-order systems. Next, we describe two kinds of principal-component coordinates of a measured reflectance spectrum, one obtained by least-square best fit and the other by tristimulus match under one or more specified lights. Finally, we show illustrative examples, and propose some possible new uses for principal-component analysis of reflectances. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

From the reflectance spectra of 1,565 Munsell color chips (glossy collection) color characteristic vectors are computed by using the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). With the obtained color characteristic vectors, spectral reflectances of Macbeth ColorChecker's test colors are reconstructed and their spectra are shown graphically to see the fitness of our characteristic vectors. For each color, the chromaticity differences between the measured and reconstructed spectra were calculated and shown in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram. As a result, we can reconstruct the measured color reflectance spectra very closely by the first four characteristic vectors. With the first three characteristic vectors, however, color differences between the measured and reconstructed spectra were not negligible.},

Polynomial regression approaches to color scanner calibration use parameterized functions to approximate the calibration mapping over a set of training colors. These approaches can perform poorly if the parameterized functions do not accurately model the structure of the desired calibration mapping. Several studies have shown that linear reflectance models accurately characterize a wide range of materials. By viewing color scanner calibration as reflectance estimation, we can incorporate linear reflectance models into the calibration process. We show that in most cases linear models do not constrain the calibration problem sufficiently to allow exact recovery of X, Y, Z from a scanner vector obtained with three filters. By examining a series of methods that exploit information about reflectance functions, however, we show that reflectance information can be used to improve the accuracy of calibration over that of standard methods applied to the same set of inputs.},

Three possibilities in choosing a single reflectance are described here. First, we assume that all reflectances are equally likely and minimize worst-case error. Second, we adopt the assumption that reflectances follow a normal probability distribution and maximize this probability. Finally, we assume that reflectances are smooth and maximize this property. The results of our experiments show that there is significant benefit from the proposed approach in terms of the accuracy of the estimation compared with that of standard estimation methods. Moreover, the present approach introduces a notion of robustness of estimates in the form of error bars.},

One recommended step for good practise in a category rating procedure is to use a pre-trial demonstration (PTD) of the range of stimuli to be experienced. However, PTD have rarely, if at all, been used in past research on discomfort glare. In this study, two experiments were conducted to test the influence of the PTD on evaluations of discomfort due to glare. In the first experiment participants evaluated four glare source luminances with, and without, a PTD. The results suggest that using a PTD increased the reported degree of discomfort perceived for the same glare setting, although this may depend on the manner in which the PTD is presented. In the second experiment, participants evaluated four glare source luminances using PTD with three different luminance ranges: the results suggest this had significant effect on discomfort evaluations in that evaluations of discomfort were lower when a higher luminance range was used. Along with other recent studies, these findings suggest a need to derive a more robust procedure for measuring the discomfort due to glare.},

  volume = {0},
  issn = {1550-2724},
  abstract = {In lighting practice, light level is seldom considered when specifying light source color rendition. Many past studies found that sources that can enhance color saturation within a certain range, especially for red colors, were preferred, but the experiments were typically carried out with an illuminance between 200 and 500 lx and the illuminance was seldom varied in individual studies. This article reports a psychophysical study that was designed to test whether illuminance affected color preference. Four nearly metameric stimuli with a correlated color temperature (CCT) around 3000 K and a Duv of -0.005 were produced to illuminate an oil painting at two illuminance levels (that is, 20 and 500 lx). These four stimuli were carefully designed to cover a range of relative gamut (that is, IES Rg) from 100 to 125 and enhance the saturation of red and green colors (that is, Rcs,h1 and Rcs,h8). Observers compared pairs of light stimuli at a same illuminance level in a sequential mode and selected the one under which he or she preferred the color appearance of the painting. It was found that the Rg of the most preferred stimulus decreased as the illuminance increased. The stimulus with an Rg {$\approx$} 117 was the most preferred at 20 lx, whereas the one with an Rg {$\approx$} 100 was the most preferred at 500 lx. The interaction between illuminance and saturation enhancement caused by the stimuli with larger gamut areas revealed the importance of considering illuminance when specifying light source color rendition, especially when an application requires a low light level and good color rendition.},

  abstract = {In recent years the possibilities of museum lighting changed considerably; museum curators have become more and more aware of the fact that natural daylight might be harmful to some pigments, and the illumination of pictures should be controlled to be able to preserve their quality for future generations. In this paper we report about a pilot project in which we tried to make the task of the observers as easy as possible. In our experiments we used a colour tuneable light source, with which the subjects were requested to set the most pleasing light, when the source illuminated real paintings (painted copies of classical art work). Observers were asked for the most preferred correlated colour temperature. The main goal of this study was to find best CCT of the illuminant. The other goal was to find which personal (like gender) indicators, settings of illuminants can influence the colour preference.},

For each spectrum, 20 participants rated a set of objects along continuous scales of naturalness, preference, vividness and skin preference. Most of the top rated spectra, along all four scales, had average gamut greater than or equal to 100 (IES Rg\,{$\geq$}\,100) and did not desaturate red hues (IES Rcs,h16\,{$\geq$}\,0\%). Best fit models illustrate that average fidelity (i.e. IES Rf) and a proxy for red saturation (i.e. IES Rcs,h16, Rcs,h1) are salient derived measures. The results illustrate that a two-metric system of colour rendition, comprised of average metrics for fidelity and gamut, cannot fully describe colour quality and underscore the importance of a colour rendering graphic (i.e. IES Colour Vector Graphic). We propose and illustrate the utility of quantifying the shape of the IES TM-30-15 Color Vector Graphic with a best-fit ellipse.},

The goal of this work is to develop light systems and sources with an optimized spectral distribution for each specific point of the art piece. This optimization process implies to maximize the color fidelity reproduction and the same time to minimize the photochemical damage. Perceived color under these sources will be similar (metameric) to technical requirements given by the restoration team uncharged of the conservation and exhibition of the goods of art. Depending of the fragility of the exposed art objects (i.e. spectral responsivity of the material) the irradiance must be kept under a critical level. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a mathematical model that simulates with enough accuracy both the visual effect of the illumination and the photochemical impact of the radiation. Spectral reflectance of a reference painting The mathematical model is based on a merit function that optimized the individual intensity of the LED-light sources taking into account the damage function of the material and color space coordinates. Moreover the algorithm used weights for damage and color fidelity in order to adapt the model to a specific museal application. In this work we show a sample of this technology applied to a picture of Sorolla (1863-1923) an important Spanish painter title ``woman walking at the beach''.},

The spectral bands were contiguous, covering the whole visible spectrum, and their widths were chosen so that they had approximately equal weight from a color rendering point of view. All tolerances were measured in relation to a full radiator reference illuminant, for single bands and also for combinations of bands. With these results it is possible to predict the color rendering performance of an illuminant knowing only the relative energy distribution in its spectrum. Examples are given. In general, the computed performance agrees with practical judgments derived from ordinary use.},

Advantages of these systems are very well known: timelife, size, compact, variation of output flux,... One of the most applied characteristic is the possibility to obtain with the same system different colors. It is possible without complex and expensive systems to obtain a tunable spectral light. In cultural heritage lighting system it will be a very important characteristic since it will make possible to obtain an optimized spectral source. Art works lighting is a very complex problem where needs for display and conservation are in conflict. Electromagnetic radiation is an agent which causes changes in material composition of painting and therefore degradation of them. In the other hand displaying art works in good conditions requires visible radiation onto the surface of paintings. This idea is applied in the problem which arise when illuminanting Paleolithic cave paintings. In this work the authors have applied a methodology which permits optimize the color reproduction and to reduce the damage of paintings.},

ganzfeld viewing environment was created using a 750mm diameter fibreglass sphere; with a
viewing aperture on one side, an aperture of 4\textdegree{} visual angle behind which an LCD screen was
positioned on the opposite side, and an aperture through which surround lighting was delivered
atop. During the experiment a randomly assigned colour patch, of controlled luminance, was
displayed through the 4\textdegree{} aperture in the centre of the visual field, whilst the surround was lit
through the top aperture with narrowband illumination. The observer's task was to adjust the
colour patch to an achromatic appearance by moving handheld sliders, one controlling the
blueness/yellowness of the patch, and another controlling the redness/greenness. This was
repeated for 16 luminance levels, decrementing in steps of 5 L* from 85 to 10. This process was
repeated 10 times, forming a one hour session, to allow an observation of adaptation over time. 16
sessions per observer were performed, with a different wavelength of narrowband light
illuminating the sphere interior (visual surround) for each session, covering the wavelengths
400nm-700nm inclusive in 20nm intervals. The interior of the sphere was painted matt grey to
make the surround as homogenous as possible. Initial observations on data collected using this setup,

The observed curves sorted themselves out in the order of haziness and the elevation of a curve above the curve calculated on the basis of molecular scattering could be taken as a measure of the haze. ({$\delta{'}$} - {$\delta{''}$}), obtained independently from direct sun observations, was another measure of haze and on plotting these two against each other, it was found that there was clear correlation between them.Another interesting fact observed was that as Z decreased from 90\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree, log I{${''}$}/I{${'}$} had first a rapid decrease, showed a minimum near about 45\textdegree{} and for still lower values of Z showed anincrease, the increase being rapid below 20\textdegree. Calculations of primary molecular scattering showed that the curve should steadily decrease with Z right down to Z=0\textdegree. These deviations from the calculated curve became less marked on clear days but were quite evident even with apparently very clear skies. On decomposing the observed curve into the molecular scattering curve and the curve of residue, it was seen that this residue curve indicated very large intensities at small angles from the direction of incidence, decreasing rapidly as the angle increased and could be reasonably attributed to scattering by large particles present in the atmosphere.},

In this classic book, the late Marcel Minnaert accompanies the reader on a tour of nature's light and color and reveals the myriad phenomena that may be observed outdoors with no more than a pair of sharp eyes and an enquiring mind. From the intriguing shape of the dapples beneath a tree on a sunny day, to rainbows, mirages, and haloes, to the colors of liquid, ice, and the sky, to the appearance of the sun, moon, planets, and stars - Minnaert describes and explains them all in clear language accessible to the layman. This volume includes 80 new photographs, over half in color, illustrating many of the phenomena - ordinary and exotic - discussed in the book. Most of the new photos are by Pekka Parviainen, the renowned Finnish nature photographer.},

  abstract = {Extracellular photo-cone responses were isolated in the intact rhesus monkey eye by fractional recording across the outersegment layer in the fovea with a bipolar microelectrode. The cone response vs intensity function was determined in the presence of adapting backgrounds up to 106 td. Increment and decrement responses, as well as the response to the steady backgrounds were recorded. All steady state and transient response data could be described with the equationV/Vm = In/(In + {$\sigma$}n) withn = 0.74 andV andI representing total response and total incident light intensity. This invariant response function is shifted both along the intensity and the response axis with increasing background intensity. The decrease in sensitivity, corresponding to these shifts, could be attributed to cellular adaptation ({$\sigma$}-adaptation), pigment bleaching and response compression. An analysis of the threshold vs intensity function shows how each of these mechanisms contributes to produce Weber behaviour.},

The light sources were the fluorescent lamp type D65 daylight illuminant simulator, the conventional cool white fluorescent lamp for general illumination, and the fluorescent lamp for art galleries and museums, which is designed to reduce fading by cutting the ultraviolet radiation. Under controlled temperature (29{$\pm$}1\textdegree{}C) and relative humidity (59{$\pm$}2 \%), exposure was continued for 700 hours. Then the color difference ({$\Delta$}E) of each sample was calculated.Discoloration of the Blue Scale was recognized for the scale less than 3rd grade for all the lamps, but {$\Delta$}E did not exceed 2. Comparing the grade of the discoloration of the dyed fabrics with that of the Blue Scale, curcumin/iron (III) acetate, quercetin, heamatoxylin, and carminic acid were equivalent to the 2nd grade, and curcumin/hydrated lime, alumstone, and ash were equivalent to the 1st grade for each lamp. From the comparison of {$\Delta$}E of the dyed fabrics between the lamps, the average effect on fade-prevention for lamp for art galleries and museums was 28\% compared with lamp type D65, and 30\% compared with the white lamp. The maximum fade-prevention effect was 50\% for curcumin/iron (III) acetate.},

In this research, the effect of the optical radiation on the discoloration of dyed fabrics under equal level of illuminance (500 lx) on samples using the three kinds of fluorescent lamps (D65, W, NU) and the eight kinds of dyed fabrics was investigated. The following results were obtained.(1) The order of discoloration degree was D65{$>$}W{$>$}NU. On dyed fabric, differences in each mordant and each colorant especially were recognized.(2) The discoloration reduction effect of the NU lamp compared to the D65 lamp and W lamp was 33\% and 9\%, respectively.(3) The discoloration reduction effect of the NU lamp compared to the D65 was 18\% for equal irradiance and 33\% for illuminance. The equal irradiance condition was defined as changing the lamp in the museum and the equal illuminance condition corresponds to not only changing the lamp, but also keeping the illuminance equal.(4) From this experiment, we found that the discoloration of dyed fabrics showed a closer relationship to the exposure dose of illuminance (lx{$\cdot$}hr) than that of irradiance (W{$\cdot$}hr).},

In the last decade, light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been extensively replacing other light sources; nevertheless, a few studies on the influence of LEDs on degradation of natural dyes are available. In this work, the colour fading of silk samples dyed with several natural dyes (containing flavonoids and anthraquinones) and exposed to three different white LEDs is considered. The fading at the end of the exposure experiment was evaluated by measuring the variations induced by the LEDs on the colour coordinates of the samples and by investigating the variation of the concentration of the dyes by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo-diode array and mass spectrometric detectors. The information obtained gives an in-depth picture of the fading by considering the actual damage potential of LEDs on natural dyes, which is relevant for selecting the most suitable lamps for display cases.},

  abstract = {In 2004, CIE issued a technical report (CIE 157: 2004) entitled "Control of Damage to Museum Objects by Optical Radiation," in which it recommended that materials classified as highly responsive to light (ex. blue wool standard 1 to 3) be exposed for a maximum of 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr. The aim of this report is to validate the new CIE recommendation for natural yellow dyes categorized below the blue scale grade 4. Twenty types of natural yellow dyes on silk were exposed to both white and non-UV fluorescent museum lamps. Color differences were measured at 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr (500 lx at fabric surface x 300 hr) intervals for 10 times, for an accumulated exposure totaling 150000 lx{$\cdot$}hr. The results show that non-UV fluorescent museumlamp was 24\% more effective in reducing the fading rate compared with white fluorescent lamp. Complying with the new CIE recommended maximum exposure of 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr, the fading rate for most yellow dyes, will be below the noticeable fading degree ({$\Delta$}E1.6) thus, the CIE recommendation is valid. However, additional dyes should also be classified as "extremely highly responsive." The limiting exposure for Ukon (Turmeric, Cucuma longa L., colorant: curcumin) should be 3500 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr, and Kihada (Amur cork tree, Phellodendron amurencse Rupr., colorant: berberine) and Onion skin (Allium cepa L., colorant: quercetin) should be 8000{$\sim$}12000 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr. This study demonstrated a need for revised classification of "extremely highly responsive" materials under museum lighting conditions.},

The color degradation of natural dyes and blue scale standards (JIS L 0841) by white LED lamps are examined, and the performance of white LED lamps for museum lighting is evaluated. Blue scale standard grades 1-6 and silk fabrics dyed with 22 types of natural dyes classified as mid to highly responsive in a CIE technical report (CIE157:2004) were exposed to five types of white LED lamps using different luminescence methods and color temperatures. Color changes were measured at each 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr (500 lx at fabric surface \texttimes{} 300 hr) interval ten times. The accumulated exposure totaled 150000 lx{$\cdot$}hr. The data on conventional white LED lamps and previously reported white fluorescent (W) and museum fluorescent (NU) lamps was evaluated. All the white LED lamps showed lower fading rates compared with a W lamp on a blue scale grade 1. The fading rate of natural dyes in total was the same between an NU lamp (3000 K) and a white LED lamp (2869 K). However, yellow natural dyes showed higher fading rates with the white LED lamp. This tendency is due to the high power characteristic of the LED lamp around 400-500 nm, which possibly contributes to the photo-fading action on the dyes. The most faded yellow dyes were Ukon (Curcuma longa L.) and Kihada (Phellodendron amurense Rupr.), and these are frequently used in historic artifacts such as kimono, wood-block prints, and scrolls. From a conservation point of view, we need to continue research on white LED lamps for use in museum lighting.},

In this research, four additional white LEDs with various correlated color temperatures and different material constructions and three types of conventional fluorescent lamp were tested yellow textiles that were sensitive to light and ranked in the highly responsive category of the CIE Technical Report (CIE-157-2004) for blue and red dyes. The color degradation degree caused by white LEDs was almost larger than that caused by conventional NU fluorescent lamp. Among the white LEDs, the degradation degree was LED/D (7483K) {$>$} LED/UV+RGB (5265K) {$>$} LED/B+YAG (5098K) {$>$} LED/L (3633K). For the same illuminance level when the content of the 400-500 nm radiation became larger, the degradation degree became larger. When the correlated color temperature was the same, the degradation degree was larger with LED/UV+RGB than with LED/B+YAG. The acceleration degree of degradation differed depending on the LED construction (combination of LED chip and fluorescent material) . From these results, it can be determined that for introducing white LEDs to museum lighting, not only the annual maximum exposure but also the material construction (combination of LED chip and phosphor) should be considered.},

  abstract = {General Introduction After spending many years working on colour and appearance in industry, I became aware of a gross ignorance of the origin of the colour and beauty existing around me in nature. The results of the succeeding awakening formed the theme of my retiring address as Chairman of The Colour Group (Great Britain) on 13th May, 1981, at the Royal Institution, London. Life, it seems, was destined to become coloured from the start and it has become a more and more colourful place as evolution has continued. Colour and design are vital, in different ways, to the life and perpetuation of different biological systems. I have attempted to amalgamate the views of the biologist, biochemist, anthropologist, and physicist (among others), to give a personal overall view of the driving forces and principles of appearance and colouration in the world of nature. The three articles to follow consider, first, the mechanisms which result in the colour of primary producers using the photosynthetic process; second, the mechanisms which produce colouration and total appearance in flowering plants and animals; and third, human colouration and man's use of colour, stopping short of modern technology. I hope that these findings will add to the everyday joy which you can experience in your natural environment.},

To understand the effect of light on appearance of paintings, few studies have experimented to establish a relation between pleasantness with the correlated colour temperature (CCT) of light. However, some studies have found that CCT has no significant effect on pleasant appearance of painting. Therefore, in this article, an experiment with a qualitative (questionnaire on semantic differential scale, N = 30) approach was designed to understand the effect of CCT on appearance of paintings exhibited under LED lights. The findings from the experimental result depict that the appearance of paintings changes due to different CCTs of LEDs having the same illuminance. In addition, the result reveals that for both mediums of paintings considered in this study, in comparison to warm white LED and artificial daylight LED, cool white LED has appeared to be more pleasant having moderately warm feelings to the viewers.},

  abstract = {Three new sets of color-matching experiments have been made by three observers binocularly viewing a bipartite field (each half subtending 3\textdegree{}) of a three-primary colorimeter. Each set of color-matching data refers to 28 test colors scattered over the chromaticity gamut provided by the colorimeter. The luminance of each test color was 12 cd {$\cdot$} m-2; the white surround (subtending 40\textdegree{}) was maintained at 6 cd {$\cdot$} m-2. The elliptical cross sections (for Y = const) of the observed color-matching ellipsoids are compared with results previously published by MacAdam, and Brown and MacAdam. In view of the inherent experimental uncertainties of data of this kind, the new color-matching ellipses correlate well with those obtained by Brown, and Brown and MacAdam, but show significant deviations from those obtained by MacAdam's observer P. G. Nutting, Jr. The discrepancies are puzzling. A note of caution is added with regard to the usefulness of color-matching ellipses in testing line elements. A set of color-matching ellipses can reveal only little of the visual mechanism that governs the precision of color matching and its assumed direct correlation with judging small color differences. It appears that fundamentally different line elements can reproduce almost equally well a given set of color-matching ellipses.},

  title = {Melanopsin and {{Cone Photoreceptor Inputs}} to the {{Afferent Pupil Light Response}}},
  volume = {10},
  issn = {1664-2295},
  abstract = {Background: Retinal photoreceptors provide the main stage in the mammalian eye for regulating the retinal illumination through changes in pupil diameter, with a small population of melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) forming the primary afferent pathway for this response. The purpose of this study is to determine how melanopsin interacts with the three cone photoreceptor classes in the human eye to modulate the light-adapted pupil response. Methods: We investigated the independent and combined contributions of the inner and outer retinal photoreceptor inputs to the afferent pupil pathway in participants with trichromatic colour vision using a method to independently control the excitations of ipRGCs, cones and rods in the retina. Results: We show that melanopsin-directed stimuli cause a transient pupil constriction generated by cones in the shadow of retinal blood vessels; desensitising these penumbral cone signals uncovers a signature melanopsin pupil response that includes a longer latency and slower velocity to constriction than for cone-directed stimuli, and which remains sustained post-stimulus offset. Compared to melanopsin-mediated pupil responses, the cone photoreceptor-initiated pupil responses are more transient with faster constriction latencies, higher velocities and a secondary constriction at light offset. The combined pupil responses reveal that melanopsin signals are additive with the cone signals. Conclusions: The visual system uses the L-, M, and S-cone photoreceptor inputs to the afferent pupil pathway to accomplish the tonic modulations of pupil size to changes in image contrast. The inner retinal melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs mediate the longer-term, sustained pupil constriction to set the light-adapted pupil diameter during extended light exposures.},

  abstract = {The human retina contains five photoreceptor types: rods; short (S)-, mid (M)-, and long (L)-wavelength\textendash{}sensitive cones; and melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells. Recently, it has been shown that selective increments in M-cone activation are paradoxically perceived as brightness decrements, as opposed to L-cone increments. Here we show that similar effects are also observed in the pupillary light response, whereby M-cone or S-cone increments lead to pupil dilation whereas L-cone or melanopic illuminance increments resulted in pupil constriction. Additionally, intermittent photoreceptor activation increased pupil constriction over a 30-min interval. Modulation of L-cone or melanopic illuminance within the 0.25\textendash{}4-Hz frequency range resulted in more sustained pupillary constriction than light of constant intensity. Opposite results were found for S-cone and M-cone modulations (2 Hz), mirroring the dichotomy observed in the transient responses. The transient and sustained pupillary light responses therefore suggest that S- and M-cones provide inhibitory input to the pupillary control system when selectively activated, whereas L-cones and melanopsin response fulfill an excitatory role. These findings provide insight into functional networks in the human retina and the effect of color-coding in nonvisual responses to light, and imply that nonvisual and visual brightness discrimination may share a common pathway that starts in the retina.},

  shorttitle = {Spectral Sharpening},
  abstract = {Received March 8, 1993; revised manuscript accepted October 28, 1993; accepted October 28, 1993 We develop sensor transformations, collectively called spectral sharpening, that convert a given set of sensor sensitivity functions into a new set that will improve the performance of any color-constancy algorithm that is based on an independent adjustment of the sensor response channels. Independent adjustment of multiplicative coefficients corresponds to the application of a diagonal-matrix transform (DMT) to the sensor response vector and is a common feature of many theories of color constancy, Land's retinex and von Kries adaptation in particular. We set forth three techniques for spectral sharpening. Sensor-based sharpening focuses on the production of new sensors as linear combinations of the given ones such that each new sensor has its spectral sensitivity concentrated as much as possible within a narrow band of wavelengths. Databased sharpening, on the other hand, extracts new sensors by optimizing the ability of a DMT to account for a given illumination change by examining the sensor response vectors obtained from a set of surfaces under two different illuminants. Finally in perfect sharpening we demonstrate that, if illumination and surface reflectance are described by two- and three-parameter finite-dimensional models, there exists a unique optimal sharpening transform. All three sharpening methods yield similar results. When sharpened cone sensitivities are used as sensors, a DMT models illumination change extremely well. We present simulation results suggesting that in general nondiagonal transforms can do only marginally better. Our sharpening results correlate well with the psychophysical evidence of spectral sharpening in the human visual system.},

As a pioneer in the technique of mesoscopic imaging, he worked with some of the giants in vision science: Torsten Wiesel, Francis Crick, Tom Albright and many others. With insight and clarity, he shows how science is built on such relationships.

  abstract = {Summary
Humans identify four `unique hues' \textemdash{} blue, green, yellow and red \textemdash{} that do not appear to contain mixtures of other colours. Unique yellow (UY) is particularly interesting because it is stable across large populations: participants reliably set a monochromatic light to a stereotypical wavelength. Individual variability in the ratio of L- and M-cones in the retina, and effects of ageing, both impact unique green (UG) settings 1, 2, but cannot predict the relatively small inter-individual differences in UY 2, 3. The stability of UY may arise because it is set by the environment rather than retinal physiology. Support for this idea comes from studies of long-term, artificial chromatic adaptation 4, 5, but there is no evidence for this process in natural settings. Here, we measured 67 participants in York (UK) in both the winter and summer, and found a significant seasonal change in UY settings. In comparison, Rayleigh colour matches that would not be expected to exhibit environmentally driven changes were found to be constant. The seasonal shift in UY settings is consistent with a model that reweights L- and M-cone inputs into a perceptual opponent colour channel after a small, seasonally-driven change in mean L:M cone activity.},

  abstract = {Since at least the 17th century there has been the idea that there are four simple and perceptually pure ``unique'' hues: red, yellow, green, and blue, and that all other hues are perceived as mixtures of these four hues. However, sustained scientific investigation has not yet provided solid evidence for a neural representation that separates the unique hues from other colors. We measured event-related potentials elicited from unique hues and the `intermediate' hues in between them. We find a neural signature of the unique hues 230 ms after stimulus onset at a post-perceptual stage of visual processing. Specifically, the posterior P2 component over the parieto-occipital lobe peaked significantly earlier for the unique than for the intermediate hues (Z = -2.9, p = 0.004). Having identified a neural marker for unique hues, fundamental questions about the contribution of neural hardwiring, language and environment to the unique hues can now be addressed.},

  abstract = {IN 1948 the German physicist, Manfred Richter, reported that colour vision has a seasonal variation1,2. For four colour-normal subjects, he found a sinusoidal variation in the proportion of red and green required to match a monochromatic yellow, the equation known as the 'Rayleigh match'3. In summer, subjects required more red in their mixture. The measurements were made with the Nagel anomaloscope, an instrument introduced in 19074,5 and which today, essentially unchanged, remains the definitive clinical instrument for classifying the many phenotypic variations in colour vision. The variation that Richter recorded in the red\textendash{}green ratio was large (three Nagel units), and it now takes on fresh interest because it is comparable in size to the difference in Nagel settings later reported between normal observers of different genetic types6,7. We have been able to replicate Richter's result, but report here that it is almost certainly instrumental: the Nagel anomaloscope proves to be very sensitive to ambient temperature.},

Colour shifts were induced with two Planckian illuminants, standard illuminant A (u{${'}$}=0.256, v{${'}$}=0.524) and illuminant S (u{${'}$}=0.174, v{${'}$}=0.392). Measurements were conducted with a 20\textdegree{} field and a 120\textdegree{} field. Adaptation period varied from 1 to 30s with the smaller field and from 1 to 60s with the larger field. Colour shifts were specified in terms of a modified Brunswik ratio (BR). Higher values of BR were associated with longer adaptation periods but only when the larger background was used. Supplementary experiments showed that the changes in colour appearance were related to a slight shift in the perceived colour of the background. The timing of the colour shifts are modelled in terms of cone opponent responses. High values of BR correspond to almost complete von Kries adaptation in all three cone types.},

By use of the simple vector-subspace model that we propose, spectral information can be stored and recovered by the use of a few inner products, which are easy to measure optically. Two large data sets, the first consisting of 1257 Munsell colors and the other of 218 naturally occurring spectral reflectances, were analyzed to form two bases for the model. The Munsell basis can be used to represent the natural colors, and the basis derived from the natural data can be used to represent the Munsell data. The proposed vector-subspace model includes a simple relation between the inner products and conventional color coordinates. It also provides a way to estimate the spectrum of an object that has known chromaticity coordinates.},

  isbn = {978-0-470-05829-9},
  abstract = {A human observer is able to recognize the color of objects irrespective of the light used to illuminate them. This is called color constancy. A digital camera uses a sensor to measure the reflected light, meaning that the measured color at each pixel varies according to the color of the illuminant. Therefore, the resulting colors may not be the same as the colors that were perceived by the observer. Obtaining color constant descriptors from image pixels is not only important for digital photography, but also valuable for computer vision, color-based automatic object recognition, and color image processing in general. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of color constancy, describing all the major color constancy algorithms, as well as presenting cutting edge research in the area of color image processing. Beginning with an in-depth look at the human visual system, Ebner goes on to:  examine the theory of color image formation, color reproduction and different color spaces; discuss algorithms for color constancy under both uniform and non-uniform illuminants; describe methods for shadow removal and shadow attenuation in digital images; evaluate the various algorithms for object recognition and color constancy and compare this to data obtained from experimental psychology; set out the different algorithms as pseudo code in an appendix at the end of the book.  Color Constancy is an ideal reference for practising engineers, computer scientists and researchers working in the area of digital color image processing. It may also be useful for biologists or scientists in general who are interested in computational theories of the visual brain and bio-inspired engineering systems.},

We formulate computational color constancy as a statistical estimation problem. We assume that the likelihood that any particular illuminant or surface will occur in a scene is governed by a prior probability distribution. In particular, we assume that illuminant spectral power distributions are drawn according to multivariate normal distribution over the weights of a finite dimensional linear model, and similarly for surface reflectance functions. Given a set of photosensor responses, Bayes rule may be applied to derive the posterior distribution for illuminants and surfaces. We discuss how to use the posterior to estimate the illuminant. We use simulation to compare the performance of a Bayesian algorithm to that of two previously reported color constancy algorithms. For our simulation conditions, the Bayesian algorithm results in the smallest expected estimation error.},

Forsyth's method invokes the constraint that the surface colors under a canonical illuminant all fall within an established maximal convex gamut of possible colors. However, the method works only when restrictive conditions are imposed on the world: the illumination must be uniform, the surfaces must be planar, and there can be no specularities. To overcome these restrictions, we modify Forsyth's algorithm so that it works with the colors under a perspective projection (in a chromaticity space). The new algorithm working in perspective is simpler than Forsyth's method and more importantly the restrictions on the illuminant, surface shape and specularities can be relaxed. The algorithm is then extended to include a maximal gamut constraint on a set of illuminants that is analogous to the gamut constraint on surface colors. Tests on real images show that the algorithm provides good color constancy.},

In this study, we compared color constancy for a 3-D miniature room (a real scene consisting of actual objects) and 2-D still images of that room presented on a monitor using three viewing methods: binocular viewing, monocular viewing, and head movement. We found that color constancy was better for the 3-D room; however, color constancy for the 2-D image improved when the viewing method caused the scene to be perceived more like a 3-D scene. Separate measurements of the perceptual 3-D effect of each viewing method also supported these results. An additional experiment comparing a miniature room and its image with and without texture suggested that surface texture of scene objects contributes to color constancy.},

However, we know little about how observers make judgments of the surface color of glossy objects, particularly in complex lighting environments that introduce complex spatial patterns of chromatic variation across an object's surface. To address this question, we measured thresholds for reflectance discrimination using computer-rendered stimuli under environmental illumination. In Experiment 1, we found that glossiness and shape had small effects on discrimination thresholds. Importantly, discrimination ellipses extended along the direction in which the chromaticities in the environmental illumination spread. In Experiment 2, we also found that the observers' abilities to judge surface colors were worse in lighting environments with an atypical chromatic distribution.},

  abstract = {Many perceptual dimensions are thought to be represented relative to an average value or norm. Models of norm-based coding assume that the norm appears psychologically neutral because it reflects a neutral response in the underlying neural code. We tested this assumption in human color vision by asking how judgments of ``white'' are affected as neural responses are altered by adaptation. The adapting color was varied to determine the stimulus level that did not bias the observer's subjective white point. This level represents a response norm at the stages at which sensitivity is regulated by the adaptation, and we show that these response norms correspond to the perceptually neutral stimulus and that they can account for how the perception of white varies both across different observers and within the same observer at different locations in the visual field. We also show that individual differences in perceived white are reduced when observers are exposed to a common white adapting stimulus, suggesting that the perceptual differences are due in part to differences in how neural responses are normalized. These results suggest a close link between the norms for appearance and coding in color vision and illustrate a general paradigm for exploring this link in other perceptual domains.},

  abstract = {Key points Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are a rare population of retinal output neurons that drives subconscious physiological responses to light, e.g. pupillary constriction, synchronization of daily rhythms to the light\textendash{}dark cycle and regulation of hormone secretion. This study investigated the functional diversity among the five known types of ipRGCs, named M1\textendash{}M5. We found that M2\textendash{}M5 cells could detect spatial differences in light intensity, implicating an ability to analyse the form of visual stimuli. All five ipRGC types responded robustly to moving lights, and M1\textendash{}M4 cells appeared to respond optimally to different speeds, suggesting they might analyse the speed of motion. M1\textendash{}M4 cells were shown to project to the superior colliculus, a brain area known to detect novel objects in the visual scene, suggesting that the form and motion information signalled by these four types of ipRGCs could contribute to this visual function. Abstract Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1\textendash{}M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based (`intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven (`extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2\textendash{}M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the `on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional `off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their `off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2\textendash{}M5 ipRGCs had centre\textendash{}surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1\textendash{}M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1\textendash{}M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field.},

Physiological studies have confirmed the existence of three classes of cone photoreceptors, and of colour-opponent neurons that compare the signals from cones, but modern work has drawn attention to unexpected complexities of early organization: the proportions of cones of different types vary widely among individuals, without great effect on colour vision; the arrangement of different types of cones in the mosaic seems to be random, making it hard to optimize the connections to colour-opponent mechanisms; and new forms of colour-opponent mechanisms have recently been discovered. At a higher level, in the primary visual cortex, recent studies have revealed a simpler organization than had earlier been supposed, and in some respects have made it easier to reconcile physiological and perceptual findings.},

  abstract = {A color appearance model (CAM) is an advanced colorimetric tool used to predict color appearance under a wide variety of viewing conditions. A chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) is an integral part of a CAM. Its role is to predict "corresponding colors," that is, a pair of colors that have the same color appearance when viewed under different illuminants, after partial or full adaptation to each illuminant. Modern CATs perform well when applied to a limited range of illuminant pairs and a limited range of source (test) colors. However, they can fail if operated outside these ranges. For imaging applications, it is important to have a CAT that can operate on any real color and illuminant pair without failure. This paper proposes a new CAT that does not operate on the standard von Kries model of adaptation. Instead it relies on spectral reconstruction and how these reconstructions behave with respect to different illuminants. It is demonstrated that the proposed CAT is immune to some of the limitations of existing CATs (such as producing colors with negative tristimulus values). The proposed CAT does not use established empirical corresponding-color datasets to optimize performance, as most modern CATs do, yet it performs as well as or better than the most recent CATs when tested against the corresponding-color datasets. This increase in robustness comes at the expense of additional complexity and computational effort. If robustness is of prime importance, then the proposed method may be justifiable.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity. They are of major importance for humans because they provide vital ecosystem services. However, as humans tend to settle near freshwaters and coastal areas, these ecosystems are also over-proportionally affected by anthropogenic stressors. Artificial light at night can occur as a form of environmental pollution, light pollution. Light pollution affects large areas on a worldwide scale, is growing exponentially in radiance and extent and can have diverse negative effects on flora, fauna and on human health. While the majority of ecological studies on artificial light at night covered terrestrial systems, the studies on aquatic light pollution have unraveled impact on aquatic organisms, ecosystem functions as well as land-water-interactions. Although monitoring of light pollution is routinely performed from space and supported by ground-based measurements, the extent and the amount of artificial light at night affecting water bodies is still largely unknown. This information, however, is essential for the design of future laboratory and field experiments, to guide light planners and to give recommendations for light pollution regulations. We analyze this knowledge gap by reviewing night-time light measurement techniques and discuss their current obstacles in the context of water bodies. We also provide an overview of light pollution studies in the aquatic context. Finally, we give recommendations on how comprehensive night-time light measurements in aquatic systems, specifically in freshwater systems, should be designed in the future.

  abstract = {The act and experience of programming is, at its heart, a fundamentally human activity that results in the production of artifacts. When considering programming, therefore, it would be a glaring omission to not involve people who specialize in studying artifacts and the human activity that yields them: archaeologists. Here we consider this with respect to computer games, the focus of archaeology's nascent subarea of archaeogaming. One type of archaeogaming research is digital excavation, a technical examination of the code and techniques used in old games' implementation. We apply that in a case study of Entombed, an Atari 2600 game released in 1982 by US Games. The player in this game is, appropriately, an archaeologist who must make their way through a zombie-infested maze. Maze generation is a fruitful area for comparative retrogame archaeology, because a number of early games on different platforms featured mazes, and their variety of approaches can be compared. The maze in Entombed is particularly interesting: it is shaped in part by the extensive real-time constraints of the Atari 2600 platform, and also had to be generated efficiently and use next to no memory. We reverse engineered key areas of the game's code to uncover its unusual maze-generation algorithm, which we have also built a reconstruction of, and analyzed the mysterious table that drives it. In addition, we discovered what appears to be a 35-year-old bug in the code, as well as direct evidence of code-reuse practices amongst game developers. What further makes this game's development interesting is that, in an era where video games were typically solo projects, a total of five people were involved in various ways with Entombed. We piece together some of the backstory of the game's development and intoxicant-fueled design using interviews to complement our technical work. Finally, we contextualize this example in archaeology and lay the groundwork for a broader interdisciplinary discussion about programming, one that includes both computer scientists and archaeologists.},

Two observers adjusted the ratio of the two test lights to maintain an achromatic appearance under conditions of adaptation that varied with respect to background luminance, chromaticity and stimulus contrast. The shift in chromaticity of the achromatic point was in the direction of the chromaticity of the background, while the magnitude of the shift increased as an increasing function of background luminance and as a decreasing function of contrast. These data confirm and extend a model of chromatic adaptation that has the following properties: (1) non-additivity of transient test and steady background fields, in the sense that the background, although physically adding to the test flash, only affects its hue by way of altering the gain of cone pathways;(2) Vos-Walraven cone spectral sensitivities; and(3) adaptation sites in the cone pathways having the same action spectra as Stiles' {$\pi$}5, {$\pi$}4and (modified){$\pi$}1mechanisms, and which generate receptor-specific attenuation factors (von Kries Coefficients) according to Stiles' generalized threshold vs intensity function, {$\zeta$} (x).},

  abstract = {The precision of human colour discrimination depends on the region of colour space in which measurements are made and on the direction in which the compared colours\textemdash{}the discriminanda\textemdash{}differ. Working in a MacLeod\textendash{}Boynton chromaticity diagram scaled so that thresholds at the white point were equal for the two axes, we made measurements at reference points lying on lines that passed at 45\textdegree{} or -45\textdegree{} through the white point. At a given reference chromaticity, we measured thresholds either for saturation (i.e. for discriminanda lying radially along the line passing through the white point) or for hue (i.e. for discriminanda lying on a tangent of a circle passing through the reference point and centred on the white point). The discriminanda always straddled the reference point in chromaticity. The attraction of this arrangement is that the two thresholds can be expressed in common units. All that differs between saturation and hue measurements is the phase with which the short-wave signal is combined with the long-/middle-wave signal. Except for chromaticities very close to the white point, saturation thresholds were systematically higher than hue thresholds. We offer a possible explanation in terms of correlated neural noise.},

  abstract = {Since antiquity, people have searched for a way to understand the colors we see\textemdash{}what they are, how many there are, and how they can be systematically identified and arranged in some kind of order. How to order colors is not merely a philosophical question, it also has many practical applications in art, design, and commerce. Our intense interest in color and its myriad practical applications have led people throughout history to develop many systems to characterize and order it. The number of color order systems developed throughout history is unknown but ranges in the hundreds. Many are no longer used, but continue to be of historical interest. Despite wrong turns and slow progress, our understanding of color and its order has improved steadily. Although full understanding continues to elude us, it seems clear that it will ultimately come from research in neurobiology, perception, and consciousness. This book is a compendium of 165 systems, dating from antiquity to the present. In it, the chapters present a history and categorization of color systems, describe each one using original figures and schematic drawings, and provide reviews of the underlying theory. Included are a brief overview of color vision and a synthesis of the various systems.},

Ligand-field-effect colors are seen in transition-metal compounds (turquoise, chrome-oxide green) and impurities (ruby, emerald). Molecular orbitals explain the colors of organic compounds (indigo, chlorophyll) and charge-transfer compounds (blue sapphire, lapis lazuli). Energy bands are involved in the colors of metals and alloys (gold, brass), of semiconductors (cadmium yellow, vermillion), doped semiconductors (blue and yellow diamond), and color centers (amethyst, topaz). Geometrical and physical optics are involved in the colors derived from dispersive refraction (rainbow, green flash), scattering(blue sky, blue eyes, red sunset), interference (soap bubbles, iridescent beetles), and diffraction (the corona aureole, opal).},

In the first experiment, we measured colour naming for the illumination and for the colour induced by the illumination on the colorimetric grey. Results confirmed that the induced colours are approximately complementary to the colour of the illumination. In the second experiment, we measured colour constancy using achromatic adjustments. Average colour constancy was perfect under the blue daylight illumination and decreased in colour directions away from the blue daylight illumination due to undershooting and a strong blue bias. Apart from this blue bias, colour constancy was not related to illumination discrimination and to chromatic detection measured previously with the same setup and stimuli. We also observed a strong negative relationship between the degree of colour constancy and the consensus of naming the illumination colour. Constancy coincided with a low naming consensus, in particular because bluish illumination colours were sometimes seen as achromatic. Blue bias and category consensus alone explained {$>$}68\%, and all determinants together explained {$>$}94\% of the variance of achromatic adjustments. These findings suggest that colour constancy is optimised for blue daylight.},

  abstract = {We measure the color fidelity of visual scenes that are rendered under different (simulated) illuminants and shown on a calibrated LCD display. Observers make triad illuminant comparisons involving the renderings from two chromatic test illuminants and one achromatic reference illuminant shown simultaneously. Four chromatic test illuminants are used: two along the daylight locus (yellow and blue), and two perpendicular to it (red and green). The observers select the rendering having the best color fidelity, thereby indirectly judging which of the two test illuminants induces the smallest color differences compared to the reference. Both multicolor test scenes and natural scenes are studied. The multicolor scenes are synthesized and represent ellipsoidal distributions in CIELAB chromaticity space having the same mean chromaticity but different chromatic orientations. We show that, for those distributions, color fidelity is best when the vector of the illuminant change (pointing from neutral to chromatic) is parallel to the major axis of the scene\&\#x2019;s chromatic distribution. For our selection of natural scenes, which generally have much broader chromatic distributions, we measure a higher color fidelity for the yellow and blue illuminants than for red and green. Scrambled versions of the natural images are also studied to exclude possible semantic effects. We quantitatively predict the average observer response (i.e., the illuminant probability) with four types of models, differing in the extent to which they incorporate information processing by the visual system. Results show different levels of performance for the models, and different levels for the multicolor scenes and the natural scenes. Overall, models based on the scene averaged color difference have the best performance. We discuss how color constancy algorithms may be improved by exploiting knowledge of the chromatic distribution of the visual scene.},

  abstract = {The origins, development, and status of the {$\pi$} mechanism theory are reviewed. The paper is divided into four sections. In the first section Stiles's general ideas about `color mechanisms' are examined, and it is concluded that foremost amongst these is a mathematical theory that specifies certain formal rules or laws that should govern a certain class of observations. In the case of {$\pi$} mechanisms, the class of observations is that of two-color thresholds, and the defining laws are the two well-known displacement laws. Five other laws that two-color increment-threshold observations should obey, if the latter are governed by ideal {$\pi$} mechanisms, are abstracted from Stiles's writings. In the second section literature pertinent to the testing of the seven Stilesian laws is reviewed, and it is asked whether or not the seven {$\pi$} mechanisms of Stiles do in fact obey the laws. In the third section the relation of the {$\pi$} mechanism concept to physiological concepts is examined, and its relation to the `cone fundamental' is discussed; the evidence pertinent to the question: `Are any of the {$\pi$} mechanisms of the single-fundamental type?' is then reviewed. The last section is devoted to the evolution of Stiles's ideas in the period after 1959 when Stiles's own investigations and those of others propelled him to reject the initial (1953) {$\pi$} mechanism theory as an adequate characterization of the data of the two-color threshold.},

As the adaptation levels due to the mondrian are uncontrolled, the amount of the constancy generated by chromatic adaptation to the stimulus and surround is unknown. The first two experiments measure hue and saturation constancy under natural daylight illuminants in a scaling task due to chromatic adaptation to the illuminant. Both hue and saturation constancy are found to be nearly complete from chromatic adaptation to natural illuminants via a scaling task. A third experiment compares hue constancy generated by chromatic adaptation to the illuminant with the amount of hue constancy generated by a mondrian surround to the stimulus and maintaining a stable state of chromatic adaptation. Chromatic adaptation once again generates very strong constancy while the presence of a mondrian under a controlled adaptation condition seems to do little to promote constancy. These three experiments suggest that chromatic adaptation is an important part of maintaining color constancy and that the most important constancy cue from a mondrian may well be a stimulus to which the visual system can adapt.},

  abstract = {The spectrum of light reaching the eye from a surface depends not only on its reflectance properties but also on the chromaticity and spatial distribution of the illumination. Accurate estimation of surface properties, including color and material, is only possible if the visual system takes this dependence into account. A series of three studies examine whether the human visual system discounts the illumination in three-dimensional environments when estimating the color of matte surfaces. Specifically, behavioral experiments were conducted to address the following questions: (1) Do observers systematically discount secondary illumination originating from nearby chromatic objects when estimating surface color? (2) What is the effect of perceived orientation on the perceived color of matte surfaces in rendered three-dimensional scenes illuminated by a blue diffuse light and a yellow punctate light? (3) Which part of the spatial frequency spectrum of the illumination is utilized by the visual system when estimating the color of matte surfaces?
In each study, a parametric model based on the physics of light-surface interactions of matte surfaces (as they would occur in the respective experiment-specific 3D environment) was derived and fit to observers' data. The model allowed for errors in observers' estimates of the chromaticities of the light sources and/or their spatial distribution (equivalent illuminant model).
The results, taken together, indicate that in three-dimensional scenes, the visual system's estimate of surface color is affected by its interpretation of the geometric layout of the scene; the visual system effectively estimates how light flows within a scene as part of normal visual processing; and, the visual system's spatial resolution of the illumination is well matched to the task it is performing.},

  copyright = {Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.},
  abstract = {Color perception is a fundamental problem in perception because it is an example of how the visual system extracts invariant information about objects based on an ambiguous retinal image. Previous research on color perception mostly used two-dimensional scenes that consist of small numbers of flat surfaces under a uniform light source. In three-dimensional scenes, however, light reflected from an object's surface depends on its shape, pose, orientation, surface material property, and spatial location. In the face of uncertainty introduced by so many variables, can the previous findings about color constancy in simple scenes be used to generate predictions for 3D scenes? My thesis focused on studying the color perception of objects in three-dimensional scenes. The first part of my thesis consists of two experiments examining how the color appearance of 3D objects is affected by changes in object material properties. The first experiment examines the color perception of objects across variation in surface gloss. I found that observers do not simply match the average light reflected from the object's surface. Instead, the visual system compensates for the physical effect of varying gloss. The second experiment studies how people perceive color across locations on an object. I found the effect is small in comparison with the physical shift caused by the change in location. The second part of my thesis focused on color constancy of objects in complex scenes. In particular, I studied the effect of material properties on constancy of 3D objects. I found that the mean constancy index for 3D objects is lower than for 2D objects reported previously, but similar to what we measured for 2D objects in the current experiments. Constancy indices were significantly decreased when the reflectance of the background wall was inconsistent with the illuminant change. I observed that glossy materials have better constancy than matte materials when the illuminant is changed from Neutral to Yellow; but this was not true when the illuminant is changed from Neutral to Blue. Finally, I report preliminary experiments that examine the effect of depth, shape and local contrast on color constancy of objects in complex scenes.},

  abstract = {Preceding the development of modern biological techniques, psychophysical experimentation and careful reasoning alone yielded an accurate account of human color perception predicated upon three opponent processes: blue versus yellow, red versus green and white versus black (Hurvich and Jameson, 1957). That is, when one of the opponent pairs, say blue, is perceived the other, yellow, is necessarily absent. The discovery, nearly five decades ago, by De Valois, Abramov and Jacobs of neurons early in the visual pathway with spectral characteristics similar to the theorized opponent interactions provided a plausible neurobiological substrate for hue perception (De Valois et al., 1966).
In the decades since De Valois and colleagues published their seminal findings (De Valois et al., 1966), discrepancies between the properties of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells reported and behavioral evidence have weakened the interpretation that these early visual cells directly map to human color perception (Stockman and Brainard, 2010). In particular, the contribution of S-cones to each opponent system has continued to be the subject of considerable experimental attention (Neitz and Neitz, 2011; Solomon and Lennie, 2007). On the basis of these discrepancies, De Valois and De Valois proposed a cortical transformation of LGN signals amounting to a rotation of the color axes (De Valois and De Valois, 1993).
In light of evolutionary constraints and evidence from the genetic introduction of a third class of cones to a dichromatic retina (Mancuso et al., 2009), a simplied version of the De Valois model has been proposed (Neitz and Neitz, 2011; Mancuso et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2014). This model posits that the spectral opponency necessary to account for hue perception is already present in a subset of midget ganglion cells. Early reports from de Monasterio et al. (1975; 1978) described such retinal cells, with more recent support from a large sample of LGN neurons taken by Tailby et al. (2008). The goal of the research presented here was to directly test the hypothesis that hue perception is mediated by a small subset of midget ganglion cells that receive S-cone input via H2 horizontal cells.},

  abstract = {The idea that color appearance is a unitary experience is central to contemporary accounts of color. I test this idea using measurements of the shift in appearance between a bluish and a yellowish viewing context. My experiments took place within a naturalistic experimental room that contained real surfaces illuminated by computer-controlled lights and a projection colorimeter. Observers indicated appearance using asymmetric matching when the contexts were presented spatially and simultaneously. Observers also indicated appearance by naming the color category to which a stimulus belonged, by adjusting stimuli to appear achromatic, and by numerically scaling appearance. In these tasks the contexts were presented successively. I evaluate the agreement across tasks by fitting models to the appearance shifts. For each task, the shift in appearance was consistent with a model in which gains on cone-specific channels were affected by the viewing context. The shifts were in reasonable agreement across tasks for three observers. This indicates that the effects of context on color appearance are largely independent of the task used to assess appearance. Of the four tasks, asymmetric matching provided the most precise determination of the context-dependent model parameters.},

  copyright = {Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.},
  abstract = {In a series of studies on lightness perception, subjects performed a discrimination between two simulated reflectances appearing under a simulated illumination modulating sinusoidally. By manipulating the period of modulation, the time dependence of the lightness judgment was measured. If the modulations of illumination are faster than the operation of a mechanism responsible for lightness perception, the mechanism cannot compensate for the modulation, and lightness discrimination performance should suffer. Thus, the time course of lightness perception can be assessed by measuring increases of performance as the period of modulation increases.
There are three classes of mechanisms hypothesized to account for lightness perception which each have specific time courses; multiplicative light adaptation (fast, 50 to 200 ms), subtractive light adaptation (fast and slow, up to 30 sec), and simultaneous contrast (instantaneous).
Four main experiments were performed. To separate the effect of simultaneous contrast from light adaptation, targets were placed either adjacent to the background (Direct Contrast), or with a 1 degree dark annulus between the target and the background (Annulus); the annulus removes simultaneous contrast cues. Also, the targets were either increments or decrements relative to the background. Thus, the four experiments are Direct Contrast Increment, Direct Contrast Decrement, Annulus Increment, and Annulus Decrement.
Results show that simultaneous contrast is the predominant cue for lightness perception in these experiments. A control study comparing Annulus and Direct Contrast conditions for fixed illuminations also suggest strongly the importance of simultaneous contrast. Without simultaneous contrast cues (Annulus), small effects upon lightness perception occur for periods up to 120 sec. These long-term effects most likely correspond to slow adaptation mechanisms (subtractive). No difference was found between increment and decrement targets.},

  abstract = {There is strong empirical evidence that, under adaptation to another achromatic color stimulus, the lightness of an achromatic color stimulus depends on the ratio of the luminances of the two stimuli. In the present study, the suitability of this ratio principle is tested for two chromatic postreceptoral opponent channels. A Hering red/green channel and a non-Hering yellow/blue channel are specified as chromatic channels. The yellow/blue channel is defined by extrapolating the plane corresponding to unique green-white linearly to the reddish part of color space, using the plane's surface as the channel's equilibria. The experiment was run on an isoluminant plane, measured individually for each observer. Moving along an observer's measured opponent axes, eight adaptation stimuli were selected for each channel and spanned the whole range of the channel's coordinates. Red/green equilibria or yellow/blue equilibria were measured as excursions along the adaptation axes. For both presumed channels, the ratios of the equilibrium coordinates of test and adaptation stimuli were essentially constant. This supports the principle's suitability. However, small asymmetries were found with respect to each channel's opponent hues. The status of the proposed yellow/blue channel is discussed, as are conditions that might have favored the present findings.},

  abstract = {During last decades, the way of life in modern societies has deeply modified the temporal adjustment of the circadian system, mainly due to the inappropriate use of artificial lighting and the high prevalence of social jet-lag. Therefore, it becomes necessary to design non-invasive and practical tools to monitor circadian marker rhythms but also its main synchronizer, the light-dark cycle under free-living conditions. The aim of this work was to improve the ambulatory circadian monitoring device (ACM, Kronowise\textregistered{}) capabilities by developing an algorithm that allows to determine light intensity, timing and circadian light stimulation by differentiating between full visible, infrared and circadian light, as well as to discriminate between different light sources (natural and artificial with low and high infrared composition) in subjects under free living conditions. The ACM device is provided with three light sensors: i) a wide-spectrum sensor (380-1100 nm); ii) an infrared sensor (700-1100 nm) and iii) a sensor equipped with a blue filter that mimics the sensitivity curve of the melanopsin photopigment and the melatonin light suppression curve. To calibrate the ACM device, different commercial light sources and sunlight were measured at four different standardized distances with both a spectroradiometer (SPR) and the ACM device. CIE S 026/E:2018 toolbox software was used to calculate the melanopic stimulation from data recorded by SPR. Although correlation between raw data of luminance measured by ACM and SPR was strong for both full spectrum (r = 0.946, p {$<$} 0.0001) and circadian channel (r = 0.902, p {$<$} 0.0001), even stronger correlations were obtained when light sources were clustered in three groups: natural, infrared-rich artificial light and infrared-poor artificial light, and their corresponding linear correlations with SPR were considered (r = 0.997, p{$<$}0.0001 and r = 0.998, p {$<$} 0.0001, respectively). Our results show that the ACM device provided with three light sensors and the algorithm developed here allow an accurate detection of light type, intensity and timing for full visible and circadian light, with simultaneous monitoring of several circadian marker rhythms that will open the possibility to explore light synchronization in population groups while they maintain their normal lifestyle.},

  abstract = {The smoothness of reflectance spectra allows them to be represented by linear models using a small number of parameters. The question of how many parameters are required has been extensively studied by many researchers in the last couple of decades. In this thesis, this question has been thoroughly addressed by applying linear models to different spectral data sets. It was found the performance of a linear model is highly data-set dependent. Different classes of linear models have also been investigated and compared according to the purpose of minimising perceptual differences, and applied to spectral images as a means of spectral compression. A proposed method for efficient representation of spectral images was found to perform better than previous methods. The performance of linear models based on a criterion of an averaged CIELAB {$\Delta$}E*ab of 1 unit has been commonly used for the evaluation of uniform colours. However, a larger tolerance is required for the evaluation of complex images. The performance of linear models of spectral images have been psychophysically studied; the results indicated that the number of basis functions required is also related to image content from which the spectra are derived. Furthermore, a psychophysical study was carried to investigate the effect of spatial structure and complexity changes on the perceptual tolerance of linear-model representations of Mondrian spectral images. It was found the perceptual tolerance do vary with the spatial complexity of the spectral images. Statistical analysis and Fourier-frequency analysis were carried on several sets of natural and man-made reflectance spectra derived from hyperspectral images. It was found that most reflectance spectra are low-pass and are smooth functions of wavelength. A physical model was then proposed and developed using modified Gaussian functions to represent absorption properties of surfaces. Reflectance spectra can be fitted with the physical model with the intention of minimising both spectral and colorimetric reconstruction errors. Though more parameters are required for physical models when compared to conventional linear models, all modelled reflectance spectra are constrained to be in the physical range. A set of artificial spectral reflectance generated from the physical model showed better performance than Munsell spectra in terms of representing natural and man-made reflectance spectra.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing has become increasingly important for agriculture because it has the potential to provide information about agricultural crops quantitatively, instantaneously, and non-destructively. The measurements and modeling of the canopy reflectance can help gain a better understanding and lead to a better interpretation of remotely sensed data. Studies were conducted on subjects related to canopy reflectance, including leaf orientation, canopy bidirectional reflectance and modeling, and the assessment on the background contribution to the canopy reflectance. Direct measurements of the leaf angle distributions of 14 types of plant canopies were taken using a Spatial Coordinate Apparatus. Four categories of zenith angle distributions were found. These were planophile, plagiophile, erectophile, and uniform. Some canopies were found to have non-uniform leaf azimuth angle distributions and there were differences between the upper and lower parts of the canopies for some species. Field measurements were conducted to examine the reflectance characteristics of selected vegetation canopies as affected by the view and solar angles. Strong relationships were observed between the reflectance factor and the view and solar angles for each canopy although differences were found among canopies. A canopy reflectance model based on radiative transport was examined to assess the effects of the major model input parameters on the canopy reflectance. Comparisons were made between measured and the model generated canopy reflectance. The model indicated that the leaf normal distribution can have large affect on the canopy reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region, as well as the red spectral region when leaf area index is small. Large differences in reflectance were observed by using different leaf scattering functions. The bi-Lambertian leaf scattering model showed the best agreement with the measured soybean canopy reflectance data. The second derivatives of canopy reflectance were examined and used a spectral indices to eliminate soil background contribution to measured reflectance. Two "windows" of second derivatives, \$\textbackslash{}rm \textbackslash{}rho\textbackslash{}sp\{\textbackslash{}prime\textbackslash{}prime\}\textbackslash{}sb\{0.69\textbackslash{}mu m\}\$ and \$\textbackslash{}rm \textbackslash{}rho\textbackslash{}sp\{\textbackslash{}prime\textbackslash{}prime\}\textbackslash{}sb\{0.74\textbackslash{}mu m\}\$, exist which can be used to estimate plant growth parameters such as LAI. The second derivatives showed an advantage over the commonly used near-infrared:red ratio for eliminating the soil background contributions to the composite of soil/canopy spectrum.},

Animals use the variation in irradiance to adjust their internal circadian clocks, aligning their behaviour and physiology with the solar cycle. However, it is currently unknown whether changes in colour also contribute to this entrainment process. Using environmental measurements, we show here that mammalian blue\textendash{}yellow colour discrimination provides a more reliable method of tracking twilight progression than simply measuring irradiance. We next use electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that neurons in the mouse suprachiasmatic circadian clock display the cone-dependent spectral opponency required to make use of this information. Thus, our data show that some clock neurons are highly sensitive to changes in spectral composition occurring over twilight and that this input dictates their response to changes in irradiance. Finally, using mice housed under photoperiods with simulated dawn/dusk transitions, we confirm that spectral changes occurring during twilight are required for appropriate circadian alignment under natural conditions. Together, these data reveal a new sensory mechanism for telling time of day that would be available to any mammalian species capable of chromatic vision.},

Visual information is then conveyed to the second synaptic layer for encoding and transmission to the brain by ganglion cells. The parietal (third) eye of lizards does not contain bipolar cells or other interneurons. Photoreceptors synapse directly onto ganglion cells1\textendash{}4 and yet, even in the absence of interneurons, antagonistic chromatic mechanisms modulate the ganglion cell responses5,6.

  abstract = {Melanopsin is the photoreceptor molecule of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which serve as the input for various nonvisual behavior and physiological functions fundamental to organisms. The retina, therefore, possess a melanopsin-based nonvisual system in addition to the visual system based on the classical visual photoreceptor molecules. To elucidate the molecular properties of melanopsin, we have exogenously expressed mouse melanopsin in cultured cells. We were able to obtain large amounts of purified mouse melanopsin and conducted a comprehensive spectroscopic study of its photochemical properties. Melanopsin has an absorption maximum at 467 nm, and it converts to a meta intermediate having an absorption maximum at 476 nm. The melanopsin photoreaction is similar to that of squid rhodopsin, exhibiting bistability that results in a photosteady mixture of a resting state (melanopsin containing 11-cis-retinal) and an excited state (metamelanopsin containing all-trans-retinal) upon sustained irradiation. The absorption coefficient of melanopsin is 33000 {$\pm$} 1000 M-1 cm-1, and its quantum yield of isomerization is 0.52; these values are also typical of invertebrate bistable pigments. Thus, the nonvisual system in the retina relies on a type of photoreceptor molecule different from that of the visual system. Additionally, we found a new state of melanopsin, containing 7cis-retinal (extramelanopsin), which forms readily upon long-wavelength irradiation (yellow to red light) and photoconverts to metamelanopsin with short-wavelength (blue light) irradiation. Although it is unclear whether extramelanopsin would have any physiological role, it could potentially allow wavelength-dependent regulation of melanopsin functions.},

Serial electron microscopic reconstructions revealed that M5 cells receive selective UV-opsin drive from Type 9 cone bipolar cells but also mixed cone signals from bipolar Types 6, 7, and 8. Recordings suggest that both excitation and inhibition are driven by the ON channel and that chromatic opponency results from M-cone-driven surround inhibition mediated by wide-field spiking GABAergic amacrine cells. We show that M5 cells send axons to the dLGN and are thus positioned to provide chromatic signals to visual cortex. These findings underscore that melanopsin's influence extends beyond unconscious reflex functions to encompass cortical vision, perhaps including the perception of color.},

Purity discrimination is best near 400 nm, least at 570 nm and intermediate at mid-spectrum and long wavelengths. A much flatter function occurs when colorimetric purity is measured as the first step from the spectrum toward white. In this study, we applied the formulation of chromatic discrimination thresholds measured along the S-cone and M/L-cone axis to account for chromatic discrimination in the equiluminant plane. The modeling results show that the purity step from white has a 1.6 log unit calculated range, similar to the classical data. The purity step from the spectrum is much flatter. The predicted range is dependent on the individual variance in chromatic discrimination thresholds and the luminance level. We then used psychophysical procedures to test the model's predictions. The resulting purity discrimination functions were generally in agreement with the model. Our modeling indicates that discrepant data of colorimetric purity can be explained with the context of discrimination models.},

In both cases, the tones selected varied consistently with the colour. The blind responses were similar to those of the trichromats, except in the case of red and green; the blind did not differentiate these colours, whereas the trichromats associated red with a higher tone and green with a lower tone. Otherwise, the results are consistent with a well-established association between pitch and lightness, with lighter colours associated with higher tones, and darker colours with lower tones. Because the blind never had any sensory experience of colour, their matching of colour to pitch is most likely based on semantic understanding.},

  shorttitle = {Melanopsin-{{Dependent Nonvisual Responses}}},
  abstract = {In mammals, nonvisual responses to light have been shown to involve intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) that express melanopsin and that are modulated by input from both rods and cones. Recent in vitro evidence suggests that melanopsin possesses dual photosensory and photoisomerase functions, previously thought to be a unique feature of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments. In cultured cells that normally do not respond to light, heterologous expression of mammalian melanopsin confers light sensitivity that can be restored by prior stimulation with appropriate wavelengths. Using three different physiological and behavioral assays, we show that this in vitro property translates to in vivo, melanopsin-dependent nonvisual responses. We find that prestimulation with long-wavelength light not only restores but enhances single-unit responses of SCN neurons to 480-nm light, whereas the long-wavelength stimulus alone fails to elicit any response. Recordings in Opn4-/- mice confirm that melanopsin provides the main photosensory input to the SCN, and furthermore, demonstrate that melanopsin is required for response enhancement, because this capacity is abolished in the knockout mouse. The efficiency of the light-enhancement effect depends on wavelength, irradiance, and duration. Prior long-wavelength light exposure also enhances short-wavelength\textemdash{}induced phase shifts of locomotor activity and pupillary constriction, consistent with the expression of a photoisomerase-like function in nonvisual responses to light.},

The melanopsin photocycle is presently unknown but is independent of the enzymatic photocycle employed by rhodopsin and cone opsins. Recent experiments have demonstrated that red-light exposure potentiates circadian phase-shifting responses to blue-light stimuli, consistent with the hypothesis that melanopsin functions as a bistable photopigment. To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed ipRGC firing activity in response to 480-nm blue light with or without intervening long-wavelength 620-nm red-light stimulation, using in vitro multielectrode array recording of postnatal day 8 to 10 murine retina. Cell-firing responses to 480-nm light were highly reproducible. No significant potentiating or bleaching effect of intervening subthreshold 620-nm light on ipRGC firing to 480-nm light could be discerned. Further physiologic and biochemical analysis of the ipRGC photoreception is required to reconcile the presence of long-wavelength potentiation at the level of the SCN with its absence in light-induced ipRGC firing.},

Ciliary photoreceptors are well known as vertebrate rods and cones and are also found in several invertebrates. The rhabdomeric photoreceptor, in contrast, is a predominant type of invertebrate visual cell, but morphologically identifiable rhabdomeric photoreceptors have never been found in vertebrates. It is hypothesized that the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell had evolved to be the photosensitive retinal ganglion cell for the vertebrate circadian photoentrainment [2, 3, 4] owing to the fact that some molecules involved in cell differentiation are common among them [5]. We focused on the cephalochordate amphioxus because it is the closest living invertebrate to the vertebrates, and interestingly, it has rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells for putative nonvisual functions [6]. Here, we show that the amphioxus homolog of melanopsin [7, 8, 9], the circadian photopigment in the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells of vertebrates, is expressed in the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells of the amphioxus and that its biochemical and photochemical properties, not just its primary structure, are considerably similar to those of the visual rhodopsins in the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells of higher invertebrates. The cephalochordate rhabdomeric photoreceptor represents an evolutionary link between the invertebrate visual photoreceptor and the vertebrate circadian photoreceptor.},

  abstract = {Mammals rely upon three ocular photoreceptors to~sense light: rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rods and cones resolve details in the visual scene. Conversely, ipRGCs integrate over time and space, primarily to support ``non-image'' vision. The integrative mechanisms of ipRGCs are enigmatic, particularly since these cells use a phototransduction motif that allows invertebrates like Drosophila to parse light with exceptional temporal resolution. Here, we provide evidence for a single mechanism that allows ipRGCs to integrate over both time and wavelength. Light distributes the visual pigment, melanopsin, across three states, two silent and one signaling. Photoequilibration among states maintains pigment availability~for sustained signaling, stability of the signaling state~permits minutes-long temporal summation, and modest spectral separation of the silent states promotes uniform activation across wavelengths. By broadening the tuning of ipRGCs in both temporal and chromatic domains, melanopsin tristability produces signal integration for physiology and behavior.},

Their distinct role, morphology, and molecular markers indicate that they are stereotyped circuit elements, but their physiological uniformity has not been investigated in a systematic fashion. We have profiled the biophysical parameters of mouse M1s and found that extreme variation is their hallmark. Most parameters span 1\textendash{}3 log units, and the full range is evident in M1s that innervate brain regions serving divergent functions. Biophysical profiles differ among cells possessing similar morphology and between neighboring M1s recorded simultaneously. Variation in each parameter is largely independent of that in others, allowing for flexible individualization. Accordingly, a common stimulus drives heterogeneous spike outputs across cells. By contrast, a population of directionally selective retinal ganglion cells appeared physiologically uniform under similar conditions. Thus, M1s lack biophysical constancy and send diverse signals downstream.},

First, responses of rods increased linearly with flash strength, while those of rod bipolars increased supralinearly. Second, fluctuations in the responses of rod bipolars were larger than expected from linear summation of the rod inputs. Rod-OFF bipolar signal transfer did not share this strong nonlinearity. Surprisingly, nonlinear rod-rod bipolar signal transfer eliminated many of the rod's single-photon responses. The impact on sensitivity, however, was more than compensated for by rejection of noise from rods that did not absorb photons. As a consequence, rod bipolars provide a near-optimal readout of rod signals at light levels near visual threshold.},

  abstract = {Cone cells constitute only 3\% of the photoreceptors of the wild-type (WT) mouse. While mouse rods have been thoroughly investigated with suction pipette recordings of their outer segment membrane currents, to date no recordings from WT cones have been published, likely because of the rarity of cones and the fragility of their outer segments. Recently, we characterized the photoreceptors of Nrl-/- mice, using suction pipette recordings from their ``inner segments'' (perinuclear region), and found them to be cones. Here we report the use of this same method to record for the first time the responses of single cones of WT mice, and of mice lacking the {$\alpha$}-subunit of the G-protein transducin (Gt{$\alpha{}-$}/-), a loss that renders them functionally rodless. Most cones were found to functionally co-express both S- ({$\lambda$}max = 360 nm) and M- ({$\lambda$}max = 508 nm) cone opsins and to be maximally sensitive at 360 nm (``S-cones''); nonetheless, all cones from the dorsal retina were found to be maximally sensitive at 508 nm (``M-cones''). The dim-flash response kinetics and absolute sensitivity of S- and M-cones were very similar and not dependent on which of the coexpressed cone opsins drove transduction; the time to peak of the dim-flash response was {$\sim$}70 ms, and {$\sim$}0.2\% of the circulating current was suppressed per photoisomerization. Amplification in WT cones (A {$\sim$}4 s-2) was found to be about twofold lower than in rods (A {$\sim$}8 s-2). Mouse M-cones maintained their circulating current at very nearly the dark adapted level even when {$>$}90\% of their M-opsin was bleached. S-cones were less tolerant to bleached S-opsin than M-cones to bleached M-opsin, but still far more tolerant than mouse rods to bleached rhodopsin, which exhibit persistent suppression of nearly 50\% of their circulating current following a 20\% bleach. Thus, the three types of mouse opsin appear distinctive in the degree to which their bleached, unregenerated opsins generate ``dark light.''},

  abstract = {A key principle of retinal organization is that distinct ON and OFF channels are relayed by separate populations of bipolar cells to different sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). ON bipolar cell axons have been thought to synapse exclusively in the inner IPL (the ON sublamina) onto dendrites of ON-type amacrine and ganglion cells. However, M1 melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells and dopaminergic amacrine (DA) cells apparently violate this dogma. Both are driven by ON bipolar cells, but their dendrites stratify in the outermost IPL, within the OFF sublamina. Here, in the mouse retina, we show that some ON cone bipolar cells make ribbon synapses in the outermost OFF sublayer, where they costratify with and contact the dendrites of M1 and DA cells. Whole-cell recording and dye filling in retinal slices indicate that type 6 ON cone bipolars provide some of this ectopic ON channel input. Imaging studies in dissociated bipolar cells show that these ectopic ribbon synapses are capable of vesicular release. There is thus an accessory ON sublayer in the outer IPL. J. Comp.

  abstract = {Melanopsin is a novel opsin synthesized in a small subset of retinal ganglion cells. Ganglion cells expressing melanopsin are capable of depolarizing in response to light in the absence of rod or cone input and are thus intrinsically light sensitive. Melanopsin ganglion cells convey information regarding general levels of environmental illumination to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet, and the pretectum. Typically, retinal ganglion cells communicate information to central visual structures by receiving input from retinal photoreceptors via bipolar and amacrine cells. Because melanopsin ganglion cells do not require synaptic input to generate light-induced signals, these cells need not receive synapses from other neurons in the retina. In this study, we examined the ultrastructure of melanopsin ganglion cells in the mouse retina to determine the type (if any) of synaptic input these cells receive. Melanopsin immunoreaction product was associated primarily with the plasma membrane of (1) perikarya in the ganglion cell layer, (2) dendritic processes in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and (3) axons in the optic fiber layer. Melanopsin-immunoreactive dendrites in the inner (ON) region of the IPL were postsynaptic to bipolar and amacrine terminals, whereas melanopsin dendrites stratifying in the outer (OFF) region of the IPL received only amacrine terminals. These observations suggested that rod and/or cone signals may be capable of modifying the intrinsic light response in melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. J. Comp.
