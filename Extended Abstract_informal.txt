Light damaes objects, and so musuem reduce light levels as much as they can without too grossley affecting visitor experience.
Another way that they could reduce damage to objects would be to use lights with a lower CCT, because these contain a higher proportion of longer wavelengths, which are less damaging.
However, they don't do comprehensively do this, and I would feel uncomfortable advising them to do so right now, because whilst models of vision suggest that we can happily adapt to any colour of lighting, it seems as though we prefer some colours over others, and we don't fully understand why. So a change in CCT which should be irrelavent to observer experience, might actually have an impact. Historically, experiments that try to find out what the preferred CCT is come up with conflicting answers.
One possible reason for these conflicting results would be if iprgcs were involved, and there's various things to suggest that they might be. Since these haven't been known about for too long, colour constancy experiments generally haven't controlled for any iprgc activation.
We started by doing some experiements to see what happened to people's state of adaptation when we varied the levels of iprgc activation. We didn't get particularly clean results and so instead I took a step back and tried to ask the question of whether such a signal could theoretically be useful.
The end goal of this is to increase our understanding of chromatic adaptation, so that we can increase our understanding of what drives preference, so that we can advise museums on how to reduce the damage to objects without damaging visitor experience.
