	abstract = {Imaging techniques inform the conservation, research, and understanding of museum collections. Two types of imaging techniques were examined in this study: infrared (IR) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Reflected IR imaging is well established as an investigative tool for conservation providing information about condition, materials, and manufacture beyond visible light documentation. Reflected IR imaging results in two-dimensional images, which are limited in how they represent 3D objects. Three-dimensional imaging techniques, such as white light scanning and photogrammetry, extend the possibilities of digitization by recording the geometry and texture of an object. Reflected IR imaging, photogrammetry, and white light scanning were used to document six objects from the Freud Museum and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. The present study provides examples of reflected IR imaging for enhanced detection of features of 3D cultural heritage objects; discusses the potential of integrating reflected IR and 3D imaging to more fully document features of 3D objects; and investigates two 3D imaging techniques, white light scanning and photogrammetry. The study assesses the two 3D imaging techniques, one more expensive and the other more accessible, to discover whether there is a significant difference in performance for the purpose of resolving the details recorded by reflected IR imaging.},

Both the outside (skin) and inside of the objects were imaged. We used a Specim VNIR HS-CL-30-V8E-OEM mirror-scanning hyperspectral camera and took pictures at a spatial resolution of ∼57 px/deg by 800 pixels at a wavelength resolution of ∼1.12 nm. A stable, broadband illuminant was used. Images and software are freely available on our webserver (http://www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/GHIFVD; pronounced “gift”). We performed two kinds of analyses on these images. First, when comparing the insides and outsides of the objects, we observed that the insides were lighter than the skins, and that the hues of the insides and skins were significantly correlated (circular correlation 0.638). Second, we compared the color distribution within each object to corresponding human color discrimination thresholds. We found a significant correlation (0.75) between the orientation of ellipses fit to the chromaticity distributions of our fruits and vegetables with the orientations of interpolated MacAdam discrimination ellipses. This indicates a relationship between sensory processing and the characteristic of environmental objects.   If for some reason you need access to the original RAW data from the camera sensor, that can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186372 However, it is only posted for preservation purposes.

	abstract = {If surfaces in a scene are to be distinguished by their color, their neural representation at some level should ideally vary little with the color of the illumination. Four possible neural codes were considered: von-Kries-scaled cone responses from single points in a scene, spatial ratios of cone responses produced by light reflected from pairs of points, and these quantities obtained with sharpened (opponent-cone) responses. The effectiveness of these codes in identifying surfaces was quantified by information-theoretic measures. Data were drawn from a sample of 25 rural and urban scenes imaged with a hyperspectral camera, which provided estimates of surface reflectance at 10-nm intervals at each of 1344 ϫ 1024 pixels for each scene. In computer simulations, scenes were illuminated separately by daylights of correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Points were sampled randomly in each scene and identified according to each of the codes. It was found that the maximum information preserved under illuminant changes varied with the code, but for a particular code it was remarkably stable across the different scenes. The standard deviation over the 25 scenes was, on average, approximately 1 bit, suggesting that the neural coding of surface color can be optimized independent of location for any particular range of illuminants.},

For naturalness, the illuminant selected was more spectrally structured than daylight and had a low color rendering index. For preference, the illuminant was similar but produced colors a little more saturated. For chromatic diversity, the spectrum was much more structured, with clearly defined peaks in the blue, green, and red spectral regions.

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.2707},
	abstract = {Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations. Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58\% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators. Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.  [J Med Internet Res 2013;15(11):e259]},

The aim of this work is to quantify some of the physical failures of color vision performance that result from uncertainty. In computational simulations with images of vegetated and nonvegetated outdoor scenes, it is shown that color provides an unreliable guide to surface identity. It is also shown that changes in illuminant may cause colors to no longer match and the relations between individual colors to vary. These failures are generally well described by a measure of the randomness of the colors in scenes, the Shannon entropy. Although uncertainty is intrinsic to the environment, its consequences for color vision can be predicted.},

The aim of the present work was to assess psychophysically the number of basis functions necessary to reproduce entire natural outdoor scenes. Hyperspectral images of 20 such scenes were each subjected to a principal component analysis and then reproduced with a variable number of basis functions. The quality of the color approximation under daylight illumination was quantified theoretically in CIELAB space and psychophysically by spatial and temporal two-alternative forced-choice measurements in which the original and the approximated images were compared on a calibrated color monitor. Although five basis functions produced on average unit error in CIELAB space, original images were visually indistinguishable from their approximations only if there were at least eight basis functions. The combination of the spectral diversity of the natural world and the observed levels of color discrimination suggest that estimates of the minimum number of basis functions necessary to reproduce natural scenes may need to be revised upward.},

Simulations were based on 50 hyperspectral images of natural scenes and daylight illuminants with correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Estimates were made of the (Shannon) information available from each scene, the redundancies in receptoral and postreceptoral coding, and the information retrieved by an observer identifying corresponding points across image pairs. For the largest illuminant difference, between 25,000 K and 4000 K, a postreceptoral transformation providing minimum redundancy yielded an efficiency of about 80\% in the information retrieved. This increased to about 89\% when the transformation was optimized directly for information retrieved, corresponding to an equivalent Gaussian noise amplitude of 3.0\% or to a mean of 3.6×104 distinct identifiable points per scene. Using color signals to retrieve information from natural scenes can approach ideal observer efficiency levels.},

	abstract = {We examined individual differences in the color appearance of nonspectral lights and asked how they might be related to individual differences in sensitivity to chromatic stimuli. Observers set unique hues for moderately saturated equiluminant stimuli by varying their hue angle within a plane defined by the LvsM and SvsLM cone-opponent axes that are thought to characterize early postreceptoral color coding. Unique red settings were close to the +L pole of the LvsM axis, while green, blue, and yellow settings clustered along directions intermediate to the LvsM and SvsLM axes and thus corresponded to particular ratios of LvsM to SvsLM activity. Interobserver differences in the unique hues were substantial. However, no relationship was found between hue settings and relative sensitivity to the LvsM and SvsLM axes. Moreover, interobserver variations in different unique hues were uncorrelated and were thus inconsistent with a common underlying factor such as relative sensitivity or changes in the spectral sensitivities of the cones. Thus for the moderately saturated lights we tested, the unique hues appear largely unconstrained by normal individual differences in the cone-opponent axes. In turn, this suggests that the perceived hue for these stimuli does not depend on fixed (common) physiological weightings of the cone-opponent axes or on fixed (common) color signals in the environment.},

However, all of the previous studies, the authors of this article are aware of, lack in realistic viewing and adaptation conditions. In the attempt of overcoming these deficiencies, a new experiment investigating the impact of long-term memory on the color appearance ratings of 12 familiar test objects was performed. The pooled observer data were modeled in CIECAM02 color space using bivariate Gaussian functions whose centroids define the corresponding memory color centers for each test object. Comparisons with previous results obtained by Smet et al. revealed no significant differences in the reported memory color centers, but showed distinct deviations in the covariance matrices defining the shape of the fitted distribution functions. It is supposed that this new set of functions will lead to significantly different results when being used for the construction of an updated memory-based color quality metric.},

In this paper, a measurement method and an instrument (the multidirectional spectroradiometer – MuS) is proposed, which considers different light incidents and spectra simultaneously, therefore, enables measurement of light characteristics relevant for non-image-forming effects. The MuS consists of four spectroradiometers measuring in different directions. Four spectrometers using optical fibers were configured to measure the spectral irradiance within a wavelength range from 200 to 1100 nm with 5.7 nm pixel resolution. Application of the MuS facilitates a better understanding of the non-image-forming light characteristics of spaces. The MuS is tested with stable electric lighting and with dynamic daylight conditions and is proven reliable to perform continuous spectral measurements in different directions simultaneously. Results show a substantial difference in measured radiation magnitude and spectral distribution in different directions, which suggests varying impact on non-image-forming effects.},

In this work, we review evidence for two opposing theories positing either a perceptual or cognitive origin of concurrent colors: the cross-activation theory and the conceptual-mediation model. The review covers results on inducer and concurrent color processing as well as findings concerning the brain structure and grapheme–color mappings in synesthetes and trained mappings in nonsynesthetes. The results support different aspects of both theories. Finally, we discuss how research on memory colors could provide a new perspective in the debate about the level of processing at which the synesthetic colors occur.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12262},
	abstract = {In a previous work, it was shown that there is a curious problem with the benchmark Color Checker dataset for illuminant estimation. To wit, this dataset has at least 3 different sets of ground-truths. Typically, for a single algorithm a single ground-truth is used. But then different algorithms, whose performance is measured with respect to different ground-truths, are compared against each other and then ranked. This makes no sense. In fact it is nonsense. We show in this paper that there are also errors in how each ground-truth set was calculated. As a result, all performance rankings based on the Color Checker dataset - and there are scores of these - are ill-founded. In this paper, we re-generate a new 'recommended' set of ground-truth based on the calculation methodology described by Shi and Funt. We then review the performance evaluation of a range of illuminant estimation algorithms. Compared with the legacy ground-truths, we find that the difference in how algorithms perform can be large with many local rankings of algorithms being reversed. Finally, we draw the readers attention to our new 'open' data repository which, we hope, will allow the Color Checker set to be rehabilitated and, once again, to become a useful benchmark for illuminant estimation algorithms.},

The circadian illuminance (CIL) and melatonin suppression value (MSV) were introduced as representative figures of merits for spectroscopically evaluating non-visual characteristics. A VR/AR-like custom-made instrument was used to study how the SPD of the display light source affects non-visual characteristics. Moreover, using multilayer thin-film filters, optimal conditions for minimizing the change of the visual color characteristics of the display while reducing the influence on the non-visual characteristics are also discussed. For the AR device, we found that its spectrum was mostly affected by external light rather than by the spectrum of the AR display itself.},

	abstract = {Deimatic displays are a type of anti-predator behaviour that startles the predator. They have received much recent theoretical attention, enabling the empirical study of this phenomenon within a predictive framework. It has long been known that bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua spp.), when approached by predators, open their mouth widely and expose a conspicuously coloured tongue. Here, we test whether such ‘full-tongue’ displays are triggered by an imminent predatory attack in the Northern Bluetongue skink Tiliqua scincoides intermedia and examine whether this display behaviour is consistent with the predictions from deimatic display theory. First, we demonstrate that luminance at the rear of the tongue, which is only exposed during full-tongue displays, is almost twice as high for lizard and bird receivers compared to the tip of the tongue, and that tongue colouration is generally more conspicuous to a bird than a lizard visual system. Second, staged predatory encounters using model predators reveal that lizards primarily exhibit full-tongue displays in the final stages of a predatory attack. Lizards performed full-tongue displays congruent with the predictions associated with deimatic displays, i.e. rapid exposure of conspicuous elements from a previously inconspicuous state concurrently with aggressive defensive behaviour, most frequently during the final stages of a predatory encounter. Surprisingly, we also found that lizards vary the area of the tongue exposed during chemoexploratory tongue-flicks depending on whether a predator is present or absent.Significance statementBluetongue skinks have long been known to expose their large blue tongue in response to predatory threats. However, this behaviour has never been investigated empirically. Here, we use Northern Bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) to test whether this behaviour is consistent with predictions associated with deimatic displays. We show that the rear of their tongue is UV-blue and more conspicuous to predators compared to the tip and that this ‘full-tongue display’ is only triggered in the final stages of a predatory attack.},

All illuminations were set up with a photoperiod of 12 light: 12 dark. The 24-h expression profiles of seven core clock genes (cBmal1/2, cClock, cCry1/2, and cPer2/3), cAanat and melatonin showed significant circadian oscillation in all groups, except for the loss of cCry1 rhythm in BL. Compared to WL, GL increased the amplitudes and mesors of positive elements (cClock, cBmal1/2) and reduced those of negative elements (cCry1/2, cPer2/3), in contrast to RL. The temporal patterns of cAanat mRNA and melatonin secretion have always been consistent with the positive genes. Besides, GL advanced the acrophases of the positive elements, cAanat and melatonin, but RL and BL showed the opposite effect. Thereby, GL could promote the secretion of melatonin by enhancing the expressions of positive clock genes and repressing the expressions of negative clock genes.

Because there is no simple mapping between the pattern of an object's image on the retina and its physical reflectance, our perceptions of colour and material are the result of sophisticated visual computations. A long-standing goal in vision science is to describe how these computations work, particularly as they act to stabilize perceived colour and material against variation in scene factors extrinsic to object surface properties, such as the illumination. If we take seriously the notion that perceived colour and material are useful because they help guide behaviour in natural tasks, then we need experiments that measure and models that describe how they are used in such tasks. To this end, we have developed selection-based methods and accompanying perceptual models for studying perceived object colour and material. This focused review highlights key aspects of our work. It includes a discussion of future directions and challenges, as well as an outline of a computational observer model that incorporates early, known, stages of visual processing and that clarifies how early vision shapes selection performance.},

Nocturnal light exposure in rodents has been shown to result in rapid sleep induction, in which melanopsin plays a key role. However, studies have also shown that light exposure can result in elevated corticosterone, a response that is not compatible with sleep. To investigate these contradictory findings and to dissect the relative contribution of pRGCs and rods/cones, we assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep. Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4-/-), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. We go on to show that blue light evokes higher Fos induction in the SCN compared to the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), whereas green light produced greater responses in the VLPO. Collectively, our data demonstrates that nocturnal light exposure can have either an arousal- or sleep-promoting effect, and that these responses are melanopsin-mediated via different neural pathways with different spectral sensitivities. These findings raise important questions relating to how artificial light may alter behaviour in both the work and domestic setting.},

LEDs represent an evolving technology; there are concerns about the effects of light spectra on artifacts, including textiles. Many LED models do not possess the same color rendering properties that observers are accustomed to, and it is important to understand the effects that spectra can play on dyed textiles. This research focuses on the visual effects of different light spectra, including those of LEDs, on textile colorants in order to gauge the range of color differences produced. Nine early synthetic dyes and one commercial fading standard were utilized. This paper summarizes our ﬁndings to date: that LED spectra with the same color temperature can render very different observable colors, especially with saturated colors. Saturated purples were found to be extremely hard to render accurately with LEDs. Other hues may also be compromised. Experimental work indicates that color temperature, illuminance level, and the commercial Color Rendering Index (CRI) are insufﬁcient speciﬁcations for exhibitions LED light sources. An instrumental method for assessing LEDs before exhibition installation is suggested.},

Twenty-eight participants each evaluated 26 lighting conditions in a 3.1 m by 3.7 m room filled with objects selected to cover a range of hue, saturation, and lightness. IES TM-30-15 Fidelity Index (Rf) values ranged from 64 to 93, IES TM-30 Gamut Index (Rg) values ranging from 79 to 117, and IES TM-30 red chroma shift (Rcs,h1) values ranging from −19\% to 26\%. All lighting conditions had the same nominal illuminance and chromaticity. Participants were asked to rate each condition on eight point scales for saturated–dull, normal–shifted, and like–dislike, as well as classifying the condition as one of saturated, dull, normal, or shifted. The findings suggest that gamut shape is more important than average gamut area for modeling human preference, with red playing a more important role than other hues. Average fidelity alone is a weak predictor of human perception, especially CIE Ra. Nine of the top 12 rated products had a CIE Ra value of 73 or less, which indicates that the criteria of CIE Ra ≥ 80 may be excluding many preferred light sources.},

	abstract = {The impact of the spectral composition of light on the discoloration of paint pigments has been investigated for the case of lead chromate sulfate, an unstable yellow pigment used by Vincent van Gogh and other painters. With LEDification, museum lighting is moving from using halogen to LED lamps. LED light sources have a significantly different spectral composition than halogen lamps. To understand the impact of these differences on pigment stability, the wavelength dependence of pigment discoloration was determined. Contrary to the expectation that lower wavelength photons induce more damage than higher wavelength ones, UV (394 nm), blue, and cyan light all lead to similar levels of discoloration of a pigment for the same level of radiant power. By understanding this wavelength dependence, it becomes possible to create white light LED lamps with a spectral composition tuned to minimize the degradation effect. An existing LED solution with a modified emission indeed resulted in 30\% less color change in the experiment than halogen. Furthermore, a method is proposed to optimize the LED spectra by tuning to the properties of each specific artifact. Simulations show that this can reduce the damage of the light source by 45\% in specific cases.},

This wavelength is generally related to the normal light fastness of the colouring matter, “normal” referring to the substrate for which it was originally developed, e.g. vat dyes on cotton, disperse dyes on acetate rayon. The critical wavelength decreases as the resistance to fading increases, being in the red when the light fastness is 1–2 (minimum) and in the blue when it is 6–8 (maximum); there are, however, some exceptions to this rule. As long-wave radiations preponderate in daylight and as the absorption bands are usually strongest in the visible spectrum, fugitive organic colouring matters are mainly faded by visible light, whilst those of high normal light fastness can in general be faded only by ultraviolet, violet, and blue light. The differences between the composition of actinic radiation constituting daylight and that emitted by the enclosed carbon arc have been shown to be relatively unimportant as a possible source of gross anomalies in light fastness testing based on comparison with light fastness standards. These differences do, however, render meaningless any attempts to equate one hour's lamp exposure with so many hours' sunshine.},

	abstract = {A new approach to identifying artifacts sensitive to visible light exposure, based on the direct measurement of the lightfastness of materials that compose the object, is described. An instrument has been constructed that is capable of identifying fugitive materials (more light sensitive than Blue Wool \#2) rapidly and essentially nondestructively. Accelerated light-fading tests on tiny (0.4 mm diameter) areas of an object are done while simultaneously monitoring the color change produced in the test area. The lightfastness determined in such microfading tests has been found to compare well with that measured in more conventional accelerated lightaging tests. The risks of damage to the artifacts from these microfading tests have been examined. By terminating the fading test when a small but definite color change has been produced, the risk of disfiguring the object by creating a visible bleached spot is judged to be very small. Exposure to the light intensities used in the microfading tester can heat test areas to as high as 50°C, so that low-melting materials such as waxes should be considered at risk of some degree of melting damage. For most art materials that are more heat tolerant, however, this technique holds great promise as a tool for recognizing very light-sensitive materials and for 'predicting the consequences of exhibition under particular lighting or atmospheric conditions.},

It is unclear how this percept of “pan-field colour” comes about. We use novel stimuli—“colour chimeras”—to demonstrate a related visual phenomenon in which observers perceive rich colour throughout images with large achromatic regions. This percept appears to critically depend on natural scene statistics. By separately manipulating chromatic and structural content in such images, we demonstrate that both the spatial distribution of colour and the presence of recognizable scene structure contribute to the experience of pan-field colour in these stimuli. Our results suggest that this percept is unlikely to be due to a low-level colour spreading process. Instead, we suggest that mechanisms dependent on natural scenes’ chromatic and luminance statistics provide the basis for the phenomenon.},

All colors can be described in terms of four non-reducible ‘unique’ hues: red, green, yellow, and blue [1]. These four hues are also the most common ‘focal’ colors — the best examples of color terms in language [2]. The significance of the unique hues has been recognized since at least the 14th century [3] and is universal [4,5], although there is some individual variation [6,7]. Psychophysical linking hypotheses predict an explicit neural representation of unique hues at some stage of the visual system, but no such representation has been described [8]. The special status of the unique hues “remains one of the central mysteries of color science” [9]. Here we report that a population of recently identified cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkey contains an explicit representation of unique hues.},

The scientific literature has countless examples showing that spatial and temporal features of light influence the colors we see. Studying chromatic stimuli that vary over space, time, or direction of motion has a further benefit beyond predicting color appearance: the unveiling of otherwise concealed neural processes of color vision. Spatial or temporal stimulus variation uncovers multiple mechanisms of brightness and color perception at distinct levels of the visual pathway. Spatial variation in chromaticity and luminance can change perceived three-dimensional shape, an example of chromatic signals that affect a percept other than color. Chromatic objects in motion expose the surprisingly weak link between the chromaticity of objects and their physical direction of motion, and the role of color in inducing an illusory motion direction. Space, time, and motion—color’s colleagues—reveal the richness of chromatic neural processing.},

Although qualitative comparisons between the human circadian and visual systems can be made, there still remains some uncertainty in quantitatively predicting exactly how the circadian system will respond to different light exposures reaching the retina. This paper discusses attempts to model the spectral sensitivity of the circadian system. Each of the models discussed here varies in terms of its complexity and its consideration of retinal neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Future testing to validate or improve any of these computational models will require a targeted hypothesis, as well as a suitably high level of experimental control before one model can be rejected in favour of another. Until specific hypotheses are formulated and tested, it would be premature to recommend international acceptance of any model or system of circadian photometry.},

Recent studies have shown that red light significantly increases daytime and nighttime alertness. The main goal of the present study was to further investigate the effects of daytime light exposure on performance, biomarkers and measures of alertness. It was hypothesized that, compared to remaining in dim light, daytime exposure to narrowband long-wavelength (red) light or polychromatic (2568K) light would induce greater alertness and shorter response times. Thirteen subjects experienced three lighting conditions: dim light ({\textless}5lux), red light (λmax=631nm, 213lux, 1.1W/m2), and white light (2568K, 361lux, 1.1W/m2). The presentation order of the lighting conditions was counterbalanced across the participants and each participant saw a different lighting condition each week. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that red light can increase short-term performance as shown by the significant (p{\textless}0.05) reduced response time and higher throughput in performance tests during the daytime. There was a significant decrease (p{\textless}0.05) in alpha power and alpha–theta power after exposure to the white light, but this alerting effect did not translate to better performance. Alpha power was significantly reduced after red light exposure in the middle of the afternoon. There was no significant effect of light on cortisol and alpha amylase. The present results suggest that red light can be used to increase daytime performance.},

Participants experienced four experimental conditions: a dim light control, a high circadian stimulus true positive intervention and two Night Shift interventions delivering low and high correlated colour temperature light from the devices. Melatonin suppression did not significantly differ between the two Night Shift interventions, which indicates that changing the spectral composition of self-luminous displays without changing their brightness settings may be insufficient for preventing impacts on melatonin suppression.},

Twenty-four participants (12 adolescents, 12 adults) were exposed to three lighting conditions during successive 4-h study nights that were separated by at least one week. In addition to a dim light ({\textless}5 lux) control, participants were exposed to two light spectra (warm (2700 K) and cool (5600 K)) delivering a circadian stimulus of 0.25 at eye level. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of exposure duration, indicating that a longer duration exposure suppressed melatonin to a greater degree. The analysis further revealed a significant main effect of spectrum and a significant interaction between spectrum and participant age. For the adolescents, but not the adults, melatonin suppression was significantly greater after exposure to the 5600 K intervention (43\%) compared to the 2700 K intervention (29\%), suggesting an increased sensitivity to short-wavelength radiation.

Twenty-four-hour light–dark patterns incident on the retina are the major synchroniser of circadian rhythms to the local time on Earth. Entrainment of circadian rhythms has been implicated in health and well-being.

However, the surface of the face is also innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Here, we study the hypothesis that these visible facial colors allow observers to successfully transmit and visually interpret emotion even in the absence of facial muscle activation. To study this hypothesis, we address the following two questions. Are observable facial colors consistent within and differential between emotion categories and positive vs. negative valence? And does the human visual system use these facial colors to decode emotion from faces? These questions suggest the existence of an important, unexplored mechanism of the production of facial expressions of emotion by a sender and their visual interpretation by an observer. The results of our studies provide evidence in favor of our hypothesis. We show that people successfully decode emotion using these color features, even in the absence of any facial muscle activation. We also demonstrate that this color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements. These results support a revised model of the production and perception of facial expressions of emotion where facial color is an effective mechanism to visually transmit and decode emotion.},

Because many current lighting technologies are highly inefficient, improved technologies for lighting hold great potential for energy savings and for reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions. Solid-state lighting shows great promise as a source of efficient, affordable, color-balanced white light. Indeed, assuming market discount rates, engineering-economic analysis demonstrates that white solidstate lighting already has a lower levelized annual cost (LAC) than incandescent bulbs. The LAC for white solid-state lighting will be lower than that of the most efficient fluorescent bulbs by the end of this decade. However, a large literature indicates that households do not make their decisions in terms of simple expected economic value. After a review of the technology, we compare the electricity consumption, carbon emissions, and cost-effectiveness of current lighting technologies, accounting for expected performance evolution through 2015. We then simulate the lighting electricity consumption and implicit greenhouse gases emissions for the U.S. residential and commercial sectors through 2015 under different policy scenarios: voluntary solid-state lighting adoption, implementation of lighting standards in new construction, and rebate programs or equivalent subsidies. Finally, we provide a measure of cost-effectiveness for solidstate lighting in the context of other climate change abatement policies.},

	abstract = {The primary circadian pacemaker, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain, is photoentrained by light signals from the eyes through the retinohypothalamic tract. Retinal rod and cone cells are not required for photoentrainment. Recent evidence suggests that the entraining photoreceptors are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN. The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs. In mice heterozygous for tau-lacZ targeted to the melanopsin gene locus, β-galactosidase–positive RGC axons projected to the SCN and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment or the pupillary light reflex. Rat RGCs that exhibited intrinsic photosensitivity invariably expressed melanopsin. Hence, melanopsin is most likely the visual pigment of phototransducing RGCs that set the circadian clock and initiate other non–image-forming visual functions.},

The current article examines the trends displayed in those studies considered to provide credible evidence: these do not support Kruithof.

	url = {https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/17844},
	abstract = {Light is used to illuminate objects in the built environment. Humans can only observe light reflected from an object. Light absorbed by an object turns into heat and does not contribute to visibility. Since the spectral output of the new lighting technologies can be tuned, it is possible to imagine a lighting system that detects the colours of objects and emits customised light to minimise the absorbed energy. Previous optimisation studies investigated the use of narrowband LEDs to maximise the efficiency and colour quality of a light source. While these studies aimed to tune a white light source for general use, the lighting system proposed here minimises the energy consumed by lighting by detecting colours of objects and emitting customised light onto each coloured part of the object. This thesis investigates the feasibility of absorption-minimising light source spectra and their impact on the colour appearance of objects and energy consumption.  
Two computational studies were undertaken to form the theoretical basis of the absorption-minimising light source spectra. Computational simulations show that the theoretical single-peak spectra can lower the energy consumption up to around 38 \% to 62 \%, and double-peak test spectra can result in energy savings up to 71 \%, without causing colour shifts. In these studies, standard reference illuminants, theoretical test spectra and coloured test samples were used. These studies are followed by the empirical evidence collected from two psychophysical experiments. Data from the experiments show that observers find the colour appearance of objects equally natural and attractive under spectrally optimised spectra and reference white light sources. An increased colour difference, to a certain extent, is found acceptable, which allows even higher energy savings. However, the translucent nature of some objects may negatively affect the results.},

We now report on using the color rendition engine for revealing individual and cultural differences in color quality preferences of 205 American and Chinese subjects. Our study demonstrated that the majority of individuals preferred the color blend with the same statistical figures of merit on the average but with a much larger spread of blends for Americans. For both groups, the color rendition preferences depended on the object being illuminated. This was demonstrated by illuminating a set of common colored objects and three different paintings. We conclude that the color quality of lighting can be optimized and enhanced using the feedback to change the spectral power distribution of the illuminating source depending on the object being illuminated and on the preferences of an individual observer and a cultural group.},

	abstract = {Primate color vision is based on two to three cone types in the retina, each expressing a different class of visual pigment, making them the only mammals that possess trichromacy. These pigment classes are the short wavelength-sensitive (SWS1) pigment and the long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) pigment, orthologues of the same pigments found in many other vertebrates, as well as the middle wavelength-sensitive (MWS) pigment, a paralogue to the LWS pigment. Trichromacy was achieved differently in Old World and New World primates. In Old World primates, a duplication of the LWS opsin gene occurred giving rise to a “red-sensitive” or L pigment and a “green-sensitive” or M pigment. Their corresponding L and M genes are adjacent on the X chromosome which, together with their high sequence homology, is the underlying cause for the high frequency of red-green color blindness seen in humans. In New World primates and prosimians, however, the mechanism leading to trichromacy, with one exception, is based on a single polymorphic LWS gene, from which different allelic variants encode pigments with differing spectral peaks. X chromosome inactivation limits expression to just one gene per photoreceptor meaning that trichromacy is only seen in females; while all male are red-green color blind. Despite several leading hypothesis, the reasons for the different evolutionary paths taken by Old and New World primates for trichromacy are still unclear and remain to be confirmed.},

Beginning with an overview of the atmosphere and its components, it introduces the physics that drive weather systems before setting those principles in the context of specific systems of differing scales and latitudes. Finally, the text draws this information together in relation to the problem of anthropogenic climate change. Fundamentals of Weather and Climate is enhanced by extensive pedagogical features including end-of-chapter questions, key points, and custom-drawn illustrations that enable students to more easily visualize the processes and interactions described. A Companion Website offers resources for students and instructors.

There is no unique solution to this problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both achromatic (luminance) and colour vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among ‘long-wavelength’ receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500 nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments can be incorporated into theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision—involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors—is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages.},

Their viewing behaviour during these settings is often not controlled or reported. Here I show that the results of grey settings depend on whether subjects visually explore the stimulus by looking around or fixate their gaze exclusively on the test field. Two different viewing instructions are compared with regard to the degree of constancy as measured by the shift of grey settings in coloured surrounds. In variegated surrounds (but not in uniform surrounds) there is a robust effect of viewing condition for all subjects and all surround chromaticities tested, in that exploration increases colour constancy compared to fixating the test field. Values of a colour constancy index are increased by as much as 20\% (where 100\% colour constancy means that the subject chooses as grey the mean chromaticity of the surround) with an average across all subjects and surrounds of 12.6\%. Thus, if this factor is not experimentally controlled, it could inflate variance, reduce comparability between different studies, and even lead to unwarranted conclusions if viewing behaviour unpredictably differs between experimental conditions.},

The contribution made by distant patches to instantaneous color constancy (ICC) is found to be small, with the immediate surround (i.e., {\textless}1.5-deg separation) contributing most of the constancy effect. A modified DCM technique was developed to study ICC in patients with unilateral damage to the primary visual cortex. The results of this part of the study suggest that retinal mechanisms do not contribute to ICC. Experiments carried out in subjects with cerebral achromatopsia reveal the existence of hidden constancy, even when the subjects are unable to see the result of functioning ICC mechanisms. Dichoptic implementation of the DCM technique yields reduced but significant ICC index values with more equal contribution from distant surrounds. Our findings suggest that early stage processing of chromatic information in the primary visual cortex contributes significantly to ICC, with only small contributions from extrastriate areas of the cortex.},

Change of background has been found sufficient to shift the color of a sample from the illuminant color to achromaticity or to the complementary color[horizontal ellipsis]. Constancy is found either when the illuminant is not sufficiently homogeneous for conversion or when a sample and adaptation reflectances happen to coincide. Quantitative determinations of the extent of constancy and the beginnings of conversion are reported for the first time. Theories which assign more or less independence to object as against illuminant color, which separate constancy, contrast, adaptation, and conversion, and which ascribe different behavior with respect to these mechanisms to film and surface modes of viewing, are shown to be based upon one-sided conditions under which the observations were made supporting them. A single principle has been found adequate to explain and predict how object colors change with change in illumination and background."

The same is true for the excitations of the photoreceptors, which serve as the basis for the perceived colour. However, our visual system has the ability to perceive constant surface colours despite changes in illumination1. The average chromaticity of the retinal image of a scene depends on the illumination, and thus might be used by the visual system to estimate the illumination and to modulate the correction that subserves colour constancy2,3,4. But this measure is not sufficient: a reddish scene under white light can produce the same mean stimulation as a neutral scene in red light. Higher order scene statistics—for example, the correlation between redness and luminance within the image—allow these cases to be distinguished. Here we report that the human visual system does exploit such a statistic when estimating the illuminant, and gives it a weight that is statistically appropriate for the natural environment.},

	abstract = {A sudden change in illuminant (e.g., the outcome of turning on a tungsten light in a room illuminated with dim, natural daylight) causes a “global” change in perceived colour which subjects often recognise as a change of illuminant. In spite of this distinct, global change in the perceptual appearance of the scene caused by significant changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from different objects under the new illuminant, the perceived colour of the objects remains largely unchanged and this cornerstone property of human vision is often described as instantaneous colour constancy (ICC). ICC mechanisms are often difficult to study. The generation of appropriate stimuli to isolate ICC mechanisms remains a difficult task since the extraction of colour signals is also confounded in the processing of spatial chromatic context that leads to ICC. The extraction of differences in chromaticity that describe spatial changes in the wavelength composition of the light on the retina is a necessary operation that must precede colour constancy computations. A change of illuminant or changes in the spectral reflectance of the elements that make up the scene under a constant illuminant cause spatial changes in chromatic context and are likely to drive colour constancy mechanisms, but not exclusively. The same stimulus changes also cause differences in local luminance contrast and overall light flux changes, stimulus attributes that can activate different areas of the visual cortex. In order to address this problem we carried out a series of dichoptic experiments designed to investigate how the colour signals from the two eyes are combined in dichoptically viewed Mondrians and the extent to which the processing of chromatic context in monocularly driven neurons contributes to ICC. The psychophysical findings show that normal levels of ICC can be achieved in dichoptic experiments, even when the subject remains unaware of any changes of illuminant. Functional MRI (fMRI) experiments using new stimuli that produce stimulation of colour constancy mechanisms only in one condition with little or no difference in the activity generated in colour processing mechanisms in both test and reference conditions were also carried out. The results show that the processing of ICC signals generates strong activation in V1 and the fusiform colour area (V4, V4A). Significant activation was also observed in areas V2 and V3.},

The first site's gain is controlled by the short-wavelength cones alone; the second site's gain is determined by a net “blue/yellow” opponent signal. The two sites are distinguished by spectral sensitivity, absolute field sensitivity and dynamic properties. The theory, formalized in four equations, provides a good account of these features of the increment thresholds: (1) super-additivity of the effects ofΠ1-equated long- and short-wavelength fields; (2) upward deviation of theΠ1 threshold from the Weber line on bright blue backgrounds; (3) cancellative subadditivity of fields whose mixture is in approximate blue/yellow equilibrium: (4) the “limited conditioning effect” of long-wavelength fields; (5) transient “tritanopia”.},

Recovery is complete within 5 min after steady light exposure. After exposure to the alternating repeated sequence 10-sec light/10-sec dark, the initial magnitude of the aftereffect is reduced but recovery is retarded. The results are interpreted in terms of two processes located at different levels in the hierarchical organization of the visual system. One is a change in the balance of cone receptor sensitivities; the second is a shift in the equilibrium baseline between opposite-signed responses of the red/green channel at the opponent-process neural level. The baseline-shift mechanism is effective in the condition in which repeated input signals originating at the receptors are of sufficient strength to activate the system effectively. Hence, this process is revealed in the alternating adaptation condition when the receptors undergo partial recovery after each light exposure, but receptor adaptation during continued steady light exposure effectively protects the subsequent neural systems from continued strong activation.},

Many hold that perception is perspectival because you perceive certain properties that correspond to the “looks” of things. I argue that this view is misguided. I consider the two standard versions of this view. What I call the PLURALIST APPROACH fails to give a unified account of the perspectival character of perception, while what I call the PERSPECTIVAL PROPERTIES APPROACH violates central commitments of contemporary psychology.

	abstract = {The colour rendering index was introduced at a time when a second generation of fluorescent lamps was being brought onto the market. Today a new generation of light sources based on LED technology is becoming available, so it is opportune to consider whether the colour rendering index is applicable to these relatively new sources. In the present work a series of visual colour rendering investigations are described and their correlation with the current method of calculating colour rendering index as well as with possible updates of the calculation method is evaluated. Visual experiments have shown that the CIE Test Method is not a good predictor of visual perception. A method based on calculating colour differences using the CIECAM02 colour appearance model provides better correlation between visual and calculated colour rendering values.},

	abstract = {The majority of decisions in the building design process are taken in the early design stage. This delicate phase presents the greatest opportunity to obtain high performance buildings, but pertinent performance information is needed for designers to be able to deal with multidisciplinary and contrasting objectives. In the present work, an integrative approach for the early stages of building design is proposed to obtain detailed information on energy efficient envelope configurations. By means of genetic algorithms, a multi-objective search was performed with the aim of minimising the energy need for heating, cooling and lighting of a case study. The investigation was carried out for an open space office building by varying number, position, shape and type of windows and the thickness of the masonry walls. The search was performed through an implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, which was made capable of exchanging information with the EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The analyses were conducted both in absence and in presence of an urban context in the climates of Palermo, Torino, Frankfurt and Oslo. In addition, a preliminary analysis on the Pareto front solutions was performed to investigate the statistical variation of the values assumed by the input variables in all the non-dominated solutions. For the analysed case study, results highlighted a small overall Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of the building in all locations. Pareto front solutions were characterised by low WWR values especially in east, west and north exposed façades. The area of the south facing windows was higher compared to the other orientations and characterised by a higher variability.},

	abstract = {Energy conservation in building arena is essential issue for achieving sustainable environment. However, buildings experienced significant amount of heat gain or loss through window and this will affect the thermal comfort of buildings׳ occupants. Building without window is able to save energy, but it is not recommended due to the benefits of natural light on visual comfort and the biological effect of natural light on humans. Hence, window design plays important role in building architect. One of the essential parts of window is the glazing. Selecting a window glazing is complicated when energy saving and daylighting aspects of a building are considered concurrently. Optimization techniques offer a balance solution for the contradictions in selecting a window glazing of energy-efficient building. This paper intended to reveal the impacts of window glazing on the energy and daylighting performances of building through the previous researches. Then, the optimization techniques used by various researchers in choosing a glazing are highlighted. The emerging glazing technologies were discussed as well.},

	abstract = {Apparent window size contradictions arise when optimizing simultaneously for low energy (small sizes) and visual comfort (large sizes). Diverse multi-objective optimization methods exist, but basic questions must be solved beforehand such as choosing appropriate evaluation measures. This work aims to determine the suitability of combined optimization criteria on window sizing procedures for low energy consumption with high visual comfort and performance. The paper showcases diverse measures available to valorise energy consumption and visual aspects. A series of energy and visual criteria were selected, defining acceptance thresholds for dynamic evaluations. Whole-building computer simulations were performed on a standardized office located in a temperate climate. Discrete window-to-wall ratio variations were studied to demonstrate how these criteria affect the solution space. Results were classified using a graphical optimization method, obtaining a solution space satisfying both energy and visual requirements. Most project expectations can be met within the range of sizes. However, unprotected windows barely meet acceptance criteria, needing additional control devices. Applying various related criteria with adequate values increases the diversity of acceptable solutions but too many limits it. Clear objectives and acceptance ranges have to be conceptualized in order to translate them into decisions. This becomes important when involving team design.},

We performed an exhaustive search to obtain the best set of Gaussian sensors with a combination of optimum spectral position and bandwidth. We also examined to what extent the accuracy of daylight estimation depends on the number of sensors and their spectral properties. A set of 2600 daylight spectra [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A18, 1325 (2001)] were used to determine the basis functions in the linear model and also to evaluate the accuracy of the search. The estimated spectra are compared with the original ones for different spectral daylight and skylight sets of data within the visible spectrum. Spectral similarity, colorimetric differences, and integrated spectral irradiance errors were all taken into account. We compare our best results with those obtained by using a commercial CCD, revealing the CCD’s potential as a daylight-estimation device.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24 h cycles that persist in the absence of external time cues. These rhythms provide an internal representation of day length and optimize physiology and behaviour to the varying demands of the solar cycle. These clocks require daily adjustment to local time and the primary time cue (zeitgeber) used by most vertebrates is the daily change in the amount of environmental light (irradiance) at dawn and dusk, a process termed photoentrainment. Attempts to understand the photoreceptor mechanisms mediating non-image-forming responses to light, such as photoentrainment, have resulted in the discovery of a remarkable array of different photoreceptors and photopigment families, all of which appear to use a basic opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment biochemistry. In non-mammalian vertebrates, specialized photoreceptors are located within the pineal complex, deep brain and dermal melanophores. There is also strong evidence in fish and amphibians for the direct photic regulation of circadian clocks in multiple tissues. By contrast, mammals possess only ocular photoreceptors. However, in addition to the image-forming rods and cones of the retina, there exists a third photoreceptor system based on a subset of melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). In this review, we discuss the range of vertebrate photoreceptors and their opsin photopigments, describe the melanopsin/pRGC system in some detail and then finally consider the molecular evolution and sensory ecology of these non-image-forming photoreceptor systems.},

(c) Principles of learning are not themselves learned. (d) Though all such principles are somehow instantiated in the brain, their ultimate, nonarbitrary source must be sought in the regularities of the world – including those reflecting abstract mathematical principles (e.g., of group theory and symmetry).

Colour shifts were induced with two Planckian illuminants, standard illuminant A (u′ = 0.256, v′ = 0.524) and illuminant S (u′ = 0.174, v′ = 0.392). Measurements were conducted with a 20° field and a 120° field. Adaptation period varied from 1 to 30 s with the smaller field and from 1 to 60 s with the larger field. Colour shifts were specified in terms of a modified Brunswik ratio (BR). Higher values of BR were associated with longer adaptation periods but only when the larger background was used. Supplementary experiments showed that the changes in colour appearance were related to a slight shift in the perceived colour of the background. The timing of the colour shifts are modelled in terms of cone opponent responses. High values of BR correspond to almost complete von Kries adaptation in all three cone types.},

	abstract = {It is possible to assess the damage to artworks by measuring different physical and chemical parameters. One of the most important parameters is colour difference, which is a consequence of chemical changes in the material. CIE 157:2004 ‘Control of Damage to Museum Objects by Optical Radiation’ classifies museum collections into four groups, according to different levels of light fastness. However, these classes were developed from research using traditional light sources. Even though LED technology is becoming more popular, there is no advanced evaluation of colour fading or a colour change test for contemporary artworks. This study established that the CIE 157:2004 method, based on threshold effective radiant exposure, can be applied to an actual ageing test of ultraviolet-blocked light sources including two types of white LEDs and one traditional halogen lamp. The results also present a colour fading model that can be used in museum LED lighting to predict the colour difference in contemporary photographic materials for short- and long-term exhibition. This study also provides a revised light dosage classification of modern photographic materials for museums. Moreover, the verification studies can be used as a conceptual reference for assessing the damage potential of other art materials under the tunable multi-LED system of the future.},

Prolonged and repeated exposure to a constant stimulus (adaptation) can impact responses to subsequent test stimuli, compared to a non-adapted test stimulus. Researchers often infer, based on changes to response patterns, that sensory encoding has been changed by adaptation. However, it can be ambiguous whether a given aftereffect changes sensory encoding, decision processes, or both. We propose that confidence estimates can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify whether aftereffects arise either partially or entirely from post-perceptual processes. In three experiments, we demonstrate the utility of confidence judgements in determining whether an aftereffect results from sensory or criterion changes. Given the simplicity of our approach, this tool could readily be applied to resolve contemporary controversies regarding the origins of aftereffects and the penetration of perception by cognition.},

Photographers often refer to this as when ‘the light is right’ as opposed to midday illumination when the light is ‘flat and uninteresting’. When the light of the setting sun illuminates an object or person the surfaces impart a characteristic warm glow - the warm colors of the scene can almost appear self-luminous. This paper addresses this sensation with respect to color constancy, color appearance, chromatic adaptation, and digital photography. Since photographers strive for this kind of illumination it is vital that in the design of a color model for a photographic system that we understand and preserve the photographer's control of this effect.},

However, the actual visual stimulus received by the eye is determined by both the properties of the object and the illumination. We tested whether operational colour constancy for glossy objects (the ability to distinguish changes in spectral reflectance of the object, from changes in the spectrum of the illumination) was affected by rotational motion of either the object or the light source. The different chromatic and geometric properties of the specular and diffuse reflections provide the basis for this discrimination, and we systematically varied specularity to control the available information. Observers viewed animations of isolated objects undergoing either lighting or surface-based spectral transformations accompanied by motion. By varying the axis of rotation, and surface patterning or geometry, we manipulated: (i) motion-related information about the scene, (ii) relative motion between the surface patterning and the specular reflection of the lighting, and (iii) image disruption caused by this motion. Despite large individual differences in performance with static stimuli, motion manipulations neither improved nor degraded performance. As motion significantly disrupts frame-by-frame low-level image statistics, we infer that operational constancy depends on a high-level scene interpretation, which is maintained in all conditions.},

	abstract = {For normal human observers, color is three-dimensional. The color appearance of any surface can be matched by adjusting just three variables (such as lightness, hue, and saturation). This trichromacy is mediated, but not ultimately explained, by the existence of three classes of photoreceptors -- retinal cones having peak sensitivities to longer, medium, and shorter wavelengths of visible light. Possibly, this trichromacy is the result of a more or less arbitrary compromise between (a) the larger number of dimensions required to represent the full spectral reflectance distributions of surfaces and (b) the smaller number of classes of retinal receptors needed to maintain, through denser retinal packing, higher spatial resolution for each receptor class. Alternatively, building on a linear model for color vision, as formulated by Maloney and Wandell, this paper seeks a less arbitrary basis for trichromacy in the prevailing degrees of freedom of terrestrial illumination. Natural selection may have favored trichromacy because it permits the achievement of color constancy despite terrestrial transformations of sunlight, which, unlike the variations in surface reflectances, have been limited to essentially three degrees of freedom. Any visual system, whether biological or artificial (including a system that requires merely an achromatic, shades-of-gray representation), can achieve constancy of color (and of lightness) only by first analyzing its optical input into three chromatic channels in order to compensate for the prevailing three degrees of freedom of terrestrial illumination.},

It then looks at how photoreceptors intercept light and convert it to usable biological signals, how the pigments and cells of vision vary among animals, and how the properties of these components affect a given receptor's sensitivity to light. The book goes on to examine how eyes and photoreceptors become specialized for an array of visual tasks, such as navigation, evading prey, mate choice, and communication.

The relevant features of the lamp construction are discussed briefly, and photographs of this focusing effect are shown. A simple analysis is presented that transforms the photographed cross section of the liquid interface into the true cross section by removing the effect of the cylindrical lens formed by the fluid-filled bottle, and the resulting cross section is then fitted to the shape of an ellipse. The possible cause for the shape of this liquid interface is discussed and compared and contrasted with the somewhat analogous situation of a stretched circular membrane that is subjected to different gas pressures on either side of the membrane.},

as opposed to mid-day illumination when the light is ‘flat and ninteresting’. When the light of the setting sun illuminates an object or person the surfaces impart a characteristic warm glow - the warm colors of the scene can almost appear self-luminous. This paper addresses this
sensation with respect to color constancy, color appearance, chromatic adaptation, and digital photography. Because photographers strive for this kind of illumination it is vital that in the design of a color model for a photographic system that we understand and preserve the photographer's
control of this effect.},

The visual pigments of “deep sea” fish are an exception for these do match the environmental light to give maximum sensitivity. At the low light intensities at which the rods operate, it is the number of photons that go to make upeach element of the image that limits the ability of the eye to discriminate detail and contrast. Chemically induced isomerisation of the visual pigment molecule may cause spurious visual signals that limit the ability of the eye to detect contrasts in very dim light. In bright light the spurious visual signals become insignificant in number compared to the true photon-induced visual signals. Compared to the rods, cone visual pigments do match the spectral properties of the environment exceptthat there appear to be no visual pigments with an absorption maximum beyond the 625 nm porphyropsins in cones. U.V. absorbing pigments are know in invertebrates, birds and fish that live in very shallow water. Animals have photoreceptors in parts of the body other than the eyes. In vertebrates these sites includethe pineal, chromatophores, brain, skin and harderian gland. There is evidence based on immunocytochemistry and action spectra that at least some of the skin and pineal receptors contain visual pigments, but like those of the rods, these do not match the spectral quality of the environmental light.},

Thus, the sensitivity of the eye to light of different wavelengths over the spectrum has been accurately estimated for the initial photoreceptor stage which converts light incident on the retina into neural signals. Spectral sensitivities have also been obtained, in part at least, for the subsequent post-receptoral neural pathways that apparently recode colour information into separate signals specifying luminance and chromaticity. These and other findings on receptoral and post-receptoral spectral sensitivities are considered in relation to techniques for functionally isolating colour-processing pathways in the human visual system. Also discussed briefly are models of colour vision, the relationship between form perception and colour vision, and inherited and acquired colour-vision deficiencies.},

	abstract = {The endemic cottoid fish of Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia offer a singular opportunity for examining within a number of closely related species, the relationships of visual pigments, photoreceptor complements and depth within a deep freshwater environment. The lake, the deepest (1600 m) and one of the largest and most ancient in the world, is unique in that the oxygen levels at the bottom are only reduced to about 80\% of the surface levels. We have studied, by light microscopy, microspectrophotometry and visual pigment extraction, the retinas from 17 species of Baikal cottoids that live at different depths within the lake. Generally the retinas contain, in addition to rods, large green-sensitive double cones and small blue-sensitive single cones: surprisingly for freshwater fish, the visual pigments are based on Vitamin A1 The λmax of both rods and cones are displaced to shorter wavelengths with increasing depth. Surface species have cones with λmax at about 546,525 and 450 nm and rods at 523 nm, deeper living species retain cones, but with λmax shifting towards 500 and 425 nm and with rods at 480 nm, whereas the deepest living fish possess only rods (λmax, 480–500 nm). These data clearly show a correlation between photoreceptor complement, visual pigment λmax, and depth, but question the hypothesis that there is a correlation of pigment (λmax with water colour since, in contrast to oceanic waters, the maximum transmission of Baikal water is between 550 and 600 nm.},

	abstract = {Absorbance spectra were recorded by microspectrophotometry
from 39 different rod and cone types representing amphibians,
reptiles, and fishes, with A1- or A2-based visual pigments
and λmax ranging from 357 to 620 nm. The
purpose was to investigate accuracy limits of putative
universal templates for visual pigment absorbance spectra,
and if possible to amend the templates to overcome the
limitations. It was found that (1) the absorbance spectrum
of frog rhodopsin extract very precisely parallels that
of rod outer segments from the same individual, with only
a slight hypsochromic shift in λmax, hence
templates based on extracts are valid for absorbance in
situ; (2) a template based on the bovine rhodopsin
extract data of Partridge and De Grip (1991) describes
the absorbance of amphibian rod outer segments excellently,
contrary to recent electrophysiological results; (3) the
λmax/λ invariance of spectral shape
fails for A1 pigments with small λmax and
for A2 pigments with large λmax, but the
deviations are systematic and can be readily incorporated
into, for example, the Lamb (1995) template. We thus propose
modified templates for the main “α-band”
of A1 and A2 pigments and show that these describe both
absorbance and spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors
over the whole range of λmax. Subtraction
of the α-band from the full absorbance spectrum leaves
a “β-band” described by a λmax-dependent
Gaussian. We conclude that the idea of universal templates
(one for A1- and one for A2-based visual pigments) remains
valid and useful at the present level of accuracy of data
on photoreceptor absorbance and sensitivity. The sum of
our expressions for the α- and β-band gives a good
description for visual pigment spectra with λmax
{\textgreater} 350 nm.},

	abstract = {John Lythgoe was one of the pioneers of the 'Ecology of Vision', a subject that he ably delineated in his classic and inspirational book published some 20 years ago [1]. At heart, the original book aimed generally to identify inter-relationships between vision, animal behaviour and the environment. John Lythgoe excelled at identifying the interesting 'questions' in the ecology of an animal that fitted the 'answers' presented by an analysis of the visual system. Over the last twenty years, however, since Lythgoe's landmark publication, much progress has been made and the field has broadened considerably. In particular, our understanding of the 'adaptive mechanisms' underlying the ecology of vision has reached considerable depths, extending to the molecular dimension, partly as a result of development and application of new techniques. This complements the advances made in parallel in clinically oriented vision research [2]. The current book endeavours to review the progress made in the ecology of vision field by bringing together many of the major researchers presently active in the expanded subject area. The contents deal with theoretical and physical considerations of light and photoreception, present examples of visual system structure and function, and delve into aspects of visual behaviour and communi cation. Throughout the book, we have tried to emphasise one of the major themes to emerge within the ecology of vision: the high degree of adaptability that visual mechanisms are capable of undergoing in response to diverse, and dynamic, environments and behaviours.},

In all cases, the agreement between calculated and experimental results gives confidence in the validity of the proposed curves for various engineering applications.},

Here we explore this idea using asymmetric color matching. We find that von Kries adaptation holds, regardless of whether chromatic constancy index is low or high. When illumination changes the stimulus luminance (reflectance), lightness constancy is weak and matching is dictated by object/background luminance contrast. When this contrast is masked or disrupted, lightness constancy mechanisms are more prominent. Thus von Kries adaptation is incompatible with lightness constancy, suggesting that cortical mechanisms must underlie color constancy, as expected from neurophysiological studies [Zeki, Nature 284, 412 (1980); Wild, Nature 313, 133 (1985)].},

Two basic feeding modes prevail: (1) silhouetting prey from below against the surface background light; and (2) contrasting prey against other fields of view, which are more monochromatic. Fishes that silhouette prey from below possess a single visual pigment matched to the spectral distribution of downwelling light. This maximizes the contrast between the brighter background and darker target. To predators that view prey in the horizontal fleld, their targets may appear either darker or brighter than the background. The photocontrast of a nonreflective target is maximized by a class of cones with a matching visual pigment. But the contrast of reflective (“bright”) targets is enhanced by visual pigments offset from the spectral distribution of the monochromatic blue background. Thus, the evolutionary selection of multiple photopic systems, and of color vision itself, is probably related to the maximization of visual contrast against monochromatic backgrounds.},

Their occurrence in extracts of light-adapted, cone-rich retinae suggests that they are cone pigments.

Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

According to him, this internal knowledge is the legacy of a process of internalization; a process of natural selection over the evolutionary history of the species. Shepard has developed his proposal most fully in his analysis of the relation between kinematic geometry and the shape of the motion path in apparent motion displays. We argue that Shepard has made a case for applying the principles of kinematic geometry to the perception of motion, but that he has not made the case for injecting these principles into the mind of the percipient. We offer a more modest interpretation of his important findings: that kinematic geometry may be a model of apparent motion. Inasmuch as our recommended interpretation does not lodge geometry in the mind of the percipient, the motivation of positing internalization, a process that moves kinematic geometry into the mind, is obviated. In our conclusion, we suggest that cognitive psychologists, in their embrace of internal mental universals and internalization may have been seduced by the siren call of metaphor.},

	abstract = {Statistical regularities of the environment are important for learning, memory, intelligence, inductive inference, and in fact, for any area of cognitive science where an information-processing brain promotes survival by exploiting them. This has been recognised by many of those interested in cognitive function, starting with Helmholtz, Mach, and Pearson, and continuing through Craik, Tolman, Attneave, and Brunswik. In the current era, many of us have begun to show how neural mechanisms exploit the regular statistical properties of natural images. Shepard proposed that the apparent trajectory of an object when seen successively at two positions results from internalising the rules of kinematic geometry, and although kinematic geometry is not statistical in nature, this is clearly a related idea. Here it is argued that Shepard's term, “internalisation,” is insufficient because it is also necessary to derive an advantage from the process. Having mechanisms selectively sensitive to the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation commonly experienced when viewing moving objects would facilitate the detection, interpolation, and extrapolation of such motions, and might explain the twisting motions that are experienced. Although Shepard's explanation in terms of Chasles' rule seems doubtful, his theory and experiments illustrate that local twisting motions are needed for the analysis of moving objects and provoke thoughts about how they might be detected.},

In particular, I seek further clarification from Shepard on how best to understand his claim that principles of kinematic geometry underlie phenomena of motion perception.My primary focus is on the ecological validity of Shepard's kinematic constraint in the context of ordinary motion perception. First, I explore the analogy Shepard draws between internalized circadian rhythms and the supposed internalization of kinematic geometry. Next, questions are raised about how to interpret and justify applying results from his own and others' experimental studies of apparent motion to more everyday cases of motion perception in richer environments. Finally, some difficulties with Shepard's account of the evolutionary development of his kinematic constraint are considered.},

	abstract = {The notion of internalization put forth by Roger Shepard continues to be appealing and challenging. He suggests that we have internalized, during our evolutionary development, environmental regularities, or constraints. Internalization solves one of the hardest problems of perceptual psychology: the underspecification problem. That is the problem of how well-defined perceptual experience is generated from the often ambiguous and incomplete sensory stimulation. Yet, the notion of internalization creates new problems that may outweigh the solution of the underspecification problem. To support this claim, I first examine the concept of internalization, breaking it down into several distinct interpretations. These range from well-resolved dynamic regularities to ill-resolved statistical regularities. As a function of the interpretation the researcher selects, an empirical test of the internalization hypothesis may be straightforward or it may become virtually impossible. I then attempt to cover the range of interpretations by drawing on examples from different domains of visual event perception. Unfortunately, the experimental tests regarding most candidate regularities, such as gravitational acceleration, fail to support the concept of internalization. This suggests that narrow interpretations of the concept should be given up in favor of more abstract interpretations. However, the latter are not easily amenable to empirical testing. There is nonetheless a way to test these abstract interpretations by contrasting internalization with the opposite concept: externalization of body dynamics. I summarize evidence for such a projection of body constraints onto external objects. Based on the combined evidence of well-resolved and ill- resolved regularities, the value of the notion of internalization has to be reassessed.},

Neural activity in brain regions involved in decision formation exhibits traces of previous choices. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. Models of perceptual choice construe decision formation as the accumulation of sensory evidence towards decision bounds. In this framework, it is commonly assumed that choice history signals shift the starting point of accumulation towards the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit a bounded accumulation ('drift diffusion') decision model to behavioral data from multiple perceptual choice tasks and sensory modalities, and estimated bias terms that dependent on observers' previous choices. Individual history biases in behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to affect the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention towards (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.},

The overview is referred to as conceptual, because it is structured based on core elements in the citation process: the context of the cited document, processes from selection to citation of documents, and the context of the citing document. The core elements are presented in a schematic representation. The overview can be used to find answers on basic questions about the practice of citing documents. Besides understanding of the process of citing, it delivers basic information for the proper application of citations in research evaluation.},

After more than 20 years of use, close-range photogrammetry, now for the most part entirely digital, has become an accepted, powerful and readily available technique for engineers, scientists and others who wish to utilise images to make accurate 3D measurements of complex objects. Here they will find the photogrammetric fundamentals, details of system hardware and software, and broad range of real-world applications in order to achieve this. Following the introduction, the book provides fundamental mathematics covering subjects such as image orientation, digital imaging processing and 3D reconstruction methods, as well as a discussion of imaging technology, including targeting and illumination, and its implementation in hardware and software. It concludes with an overview of photogrammetric solutions for typical applications in engineering, manufacturing, medical science, architecture, archaeology and other fields.},

Stimulus light was supplied by three gas-filled tungsten lamps modified with three glass filters and an opal glass. Chromaticity and luminance were changed by adjusting distances between the opal glass and each of the lamps. We employed the method of minimal changes and the constant-stimulus method. In the former case, the luminances of two of the stimulus components were kept fixed, while the observer was allowed to change the luminance of the other component. Ranges of chromaticities reported as white with a probability of 0.5 or more by three observers were located along straight lines near the blackbody locus, at color temperatures higher than 5500 K. With the constant-stimulus method, 45 observers judged 18 stimuli located at different positions in the neighborhood of CIE standard source C in the chromaticity diagram, all of which had luminances equal to 20 asb. The result was that an oval range of points reported as white with a 0.5 probability was obtained around CIE standard source C.},

A first step towards efficiency is the elimination of redundancy from the incoming data [2,3,4,5,6] and a second is to code the essential messages in ways that fully exploit neuronal signalling capacity [5]; a procedure that often reduces the redundancy in a nerve cell’s response.},

	abstract = {Most models of color vision assume that signals from the three classes of cone receptor are recoded into only three independent post-receptoral channels: one that encodes luminance and two that encode color. Stimuli that are equated for their effects on two of the channels should be discriminable only to the remaining channel, and are thus assumed to isolate the responses of single channels. We used an asymmetric matching task to examine whether such models can account for changes in color appearance following adaptation to contrast—to temporal variations in luminance and chromaticity around a fixed mean luminance and chromaticity. The experiments extend to suprathreshold color appearance the threshold adaptation paradigm of Krauskopf, Williams and Heeley [(1982) Vision Research, 32, 1123–1131]. Adaptation changes the perceived color of chromatic test stimuli both by reducing their saturation (contrast) and by changing their hue (direction within the equiluminant plane). The saturation losses are largest for test stimuli that lie along the chromatic axis defining the adapting modulation, while the hue changes are rotations away from the adapting direction and toward an orthogonal direction within the S and L — M plane. Similar selective changes in both perceived color and perceived lightness occur following adaptation to stimuli that covary in luminance and chromaticity. The selectivity of the aftereffects for multiple directions within color-luminance space is inconsistent with sensitivity changes in only three independent channels. These aftereffects suggest instead that color appearance depends on channels that can be selectively tuned to any color-luminance direction, and that there are no directions that invariably isolate responses in only a single channel. We use the perceived color changes to examine the spectral sensitivities of the chromatic channels and to estimate the distribution of channels. We also examine how adaptation alters the contrast-response function, how it affects reaction times for luminance and chromatic contrast, the extent to which the aftereffects exhibit interocular transfer, and the way in which the perceived color changes differ from those induced by conventional light adaptation.},

	abstract = {Computational color constancy is the task of estimating the true reflectances of visible surfaces in an image. In this paper we follow a line of research that assumes uniform illumination of a scene, and that the principal step in estimating reflectances is the estimation of the scene illuminant. We review recent approaches to illuminant estimation, firstly those based on formulae for normalisation of the reflectance distribution in an image - so-called grey-world algorithms, and those based on a Bayesian formulation of image formation. In evaluating these previous approaches we introduce a new tool in the form of a database of 568 high-quality, indoor and outdoor images, accurately labelled with illuminant, and preserved in their raw form, free of correction or normalisation. This has enabled us to establish several properties experimentally. Firstly automatic selection of grey-world algorithms according to image properties is not nearly so effective as has been thought. Secondly, it is shown that Bayesian illuminant estimation is significantly improved by the improved accuracy of priors for illuminant and reflectance that are obtained from the new dataset.},

	abstract = {The paper considers the problem of illuminant estimation: how, given an image of a scene, recorded under an unknown light, we can recover an estimate of that light. Obtaining such an estimate is a central part of solving the color constancy problem. Thus, the work presented will have applications in fields such as color-based object recognition and digital photography. Rather than attempting to recover a single estimate of the illuminant, we instead set out to recover a measure of the likelihood that each of a set of possible illuminants was the scene illuminant. We begin by determining which image colors can occur (and how these colors are distributed) under each of a set of possible lights. We discuss how, for a given camera, we can obtain this knowledge. We then correlate this information with the colors in a particular image to obtain a measure of the likelihood that each of the possible lights was the scene illuminant. Finally, we use this likelihood information to choose a single light as an estimate of the scene illuminant. Computation is expressed and performed in a generic correlation framework which we develop. We propose a new probabilistic instantiation of this correlation framework and show that it delivers very good color constancy on both synthetic and real images. We further show that the proposed framework is rich enough to allow many existing algorithms to be expressed within it: the gray-world and gamut-mapping algorithms are presented in this framework and we also explore the relationship of these algorithms to other probabilistic and neural network approaches to color constancy},

The increasing isolation of human societies from these geophysical cycles, as a result of improved living conditions, high-quality nutrition and 24/7 working practices, have led many to believe that human biology functions independently of them. Yet recent studies have highlighted the dominant role that our circadian clock plays in the organisation of 24 hour patterns of behaviour and physiology. Preferred wake and sleep times are to a large extent driven by an endogenous temporal program that uses sunlight as an entraining cue. The alarm clock can drive human activity rhythms but has little direct effect on our endogenous 24 hour physiology. In many situations, our biology and our society appear to be in serious opposition, and the damaging consequences to our health under these circumstances are increasingly recognised. The seasons dominate the lives of non-equatorial species, and until recently, they also had a marked influence on much of human biology. Despite human isolation from seasonal changes in temperature, food and photoperiod in the industrialised nations, the seasons still appear to have a small, but significant, impact upon when individuals are born and many aspects of health. The seasonal changes that modulate our biology, and how these factors might interact with the social and metabolic status of the individual to drive seasonal effects, are still poorly understood. Lunar cycles had, and continue to have, an influence upon human culture, though despite a persistent belief that our mental health and other behaviours are modulated by the phase of the moon, there is no solid evidence that human biology is in any way regulated by the lunar cycle.},

	abstract = {A new method was used to characterize computer-controlled liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The characterization, which was performed to enable colorimetric image display, included channel independence, spatial independence, screen uniformity, and colorimetry. The colorimetric model consisted of three one-dimensional look-up tables (LUTs) describing each channel's optoelectronic transfer function and a 3 × 4 matrix transformation that included black-level flare. The matrix coefficients were estimated statistically by minimizing the average CIEDE2000 color difference for a data set sampling the display's colorimetric gamut. The LUTs were recreated dynamically throughout the optimization of the matrix coefficients. The characterization was implemented with three different instruments to evaluate the robustness of the method with respect to measurement uncertainty. The average performance ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 ΔE00 and was well correlated with instrument precision. The optimization approach improved performance by a factor of two compared with direct measurements. Despite differences in instrument design, the chromaticities of each primary following optimization and black-level flare compensation were very similar. This excellent performance was a result of the display's optoelectronic properties well matching the model assumptions. The technique was also used to characterize three additional LCD displays ranging in their matching of the model assumptions. In this case, performance worsened. For one display, more complex models would be required for colorimetric characterization. Finally, a colorimetric characterization based on measurements at the center of the display and perpendicular to the face was used to predict measurements at the edges and at different angles. The results indicated that characterizations would be required at multiple positions and angles in order to achieve sufficient accuracy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Precision and accuracy requirements for photometers, colorimeters, and spectroradiometers were evaluated. When models are used to relate digital counts defining a stimulus and resulting spectral radiant exitance, displays are assumed to exhibit channel and spatial independence. A variety of tests and the results of evaluating four imaging systems are described. From these analyses, measurement accuracy is mainly limited by wavelength scale in the case of spectro-radiometers and filter fit in the case of colorimeters. Measurement precision is limited by the number of significant figures for fixed-range devices and signal-to-noise limitations for low-luminance stimuli. Display accuracy is limited by a lack of channel and spatial independence. Display precision is mainly limited by the electronic design of the display and the stability and load independence of the gun amplifiers. © 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {The relationship was derived for computer-controlled color CRT displays between spectral radiant exitance emitted and digital counts. The derivation was historical and could be traced to pioneering work in photographic sensitometry, vacuum tube physics, and broadcast television. By performing radiometric measurements relative to a display's maximum exitance, the model simplified to a two-stage model. The first stage was a nonlinear transformation relating normalized digital-to-analog converter values to device-dependent monitor tristimulus values using model parameters of gain, offset, and γ. The second stage was a linear transformation where the device-dependent monitor tristimulus values were transformed to device-independent CIE tristimulus values. By using the model, colorimetric characterization accuracy of better than 0.5 CIELAB color-difference units for 125 colors sampling the display color gamut was achieved by measuring the CIE tristimulus values of only eight colors. The model had equivalent performance to methods using extensive measurements and table lookup. © 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what' and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual cortex.},

Particularly interesting is to understand the unique contribution to the visual signal brought by cone bipolar cells, neurons typical of the mammalian retina and especially dedicated to receive synaptic input from cones. In all the species studied so far, it has been shown that cone bipolar cells occur in about ten different types, which form distinct clusters identified with a panel of both classical and modern genetic methods. Reviewed here is current literature illustrating the occurrence of morphological, molecular and architectural features that confer to each bipolar cell type exclusive fingerprints, ultimately predicting the emergence of similarly unique, albeit still partially unraveled, functional properties. Thus, differences among cone bipolar cells lay the ground for the genesis in the outer retina of parallel channels, which convey to the inner retina separate information, among others, about contrast, chromatic features and temporal properties of the visual signal.},

	abstract = {Ganglion cells (GCs) are fundamental to retinal neural circuitry, processing photoreceptor signals for transmission to the brain via their axons. However, much remains unknown about their role in vision and their vulnerability to disease leading to blindness. A major bottleneck has been our inability to observe GCs and their degeneration in the living human eye. Despite two decades of development of optical technologies to image cells in the living human retina, GCs remain elusive due to their high optical translucency. Failure of conventional imaging—using predominately singly scattered light—to reveal GCs has led to a focus on multiply-scattered, fluorescence, two-photon, and phase imaging techniques to enhance GC contrast. Here, we show that singly scattered light actually carries substantial information that reveals GC somas, axons, and other retinal neurons and permits their quantitative analysis. We perform morphometry on GC layer somas, including projection of GCs onto photoreceptors and identification of the primary GC subtypes, even beneath nerve fibers. We obtained singly scattered images by: (i) marrying adaptive optics to optical coherence tomography to avoid optical blurring of the eye; (ii) performing 3D subcellular image registration to avoid motion blur; and (iii) using organelle motility inside somas as an intrinsic contrast agent. Moreover, through-focus imaging offers the potential to spatially map individual GCs to underlying amacrine, bipolar, horizontal, photoreceptor, and retinal pigment epithelium cells, thus exposing the anatomical substrate for neural processing of visual information. This imaging modality is also a tool for improving clinical diagnosis and assessing treatment of retinal disease.},

Daylight has a broad, relatively smooth spectral distribution embracing the full colour range of the human visual system. Electric illumination has been available for barely 100 years and has developed considerably from the humble incandescent light bulb through discharge sources and now solid state light emitting devices but its measurement systems are based on a much narrower spectral distribution, agreed internationally in 1924, the CIE Vλ distribution. Systems of colour measurement came much later, but are considered insufficiently accurately for modern light sources. Possible alternatives are considered.

Six paintings were selected for detailed investigation. Representative coloured patches were measured on these reproductions from the internet, displaying them in three popular web browsers, and the data sets were compared.
Results from this research demonstrate that there are significant differences between the original artefacts and their digital reproductions, and there is a significant difference between the different web browsers. The source of this difference is very complex. One is the difference between the displaying techniques of the various web browsers, which produces a relevant aberration in colour rendering. This consequence can arise from the JPEG encoding and decoding methods. Implicit use of colour spaces in browsers, missing or incorrect EXIF data, and noncalibrated displays together can result in very different forms of colour representation.},

	abstract = {The reaction of wavelength-selective (WL), wavelength-opponent (WLO) and colour-coded (CO) cells 8 in monkey visual cortex to changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from the area in their receptive fields was studied, using multicoloured displays. Wavelength-selective and wavelength-opponent cells were found to be very sensitive to changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from the areas in their receptive fields, irrespective of their perceived natural and void colours. 8 Changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from surrounding areas did not affect their responses. They were also sensitive to the order in which lights of various wavelengths illuminated the areas in their receptive fields. Colour-coded cells were not affected by changes in the wavelength composition nor were they sensitive to the sequence with which the area in their receptive fields was illuminated by lights of different wavelengths. However, they required that the display, with the area of their preferred colour in their receptive fields, be trichromatically illuminated. This and other evidence suggested that such cells were sensitive not only to the illumination of the area in their receptive fields, but of surrounding areas as well. This evidence reinforces further the distinction between wavelength-selective and colour-coded cells and leads to the conclusion that one function of the wavelength-selective cells must be to register the changes in wavelength composition which occur throughout the day.},

	abstract = {This is the first book to introduce the new statistics - effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis - in an accessible way. It is chock full of practical examples and tips on how to analyze and report research results using these techniques. The book is invaluable to readers interested in meeting the new APA Publication Manual guidelines by adopting the new statistics - which are more informative than null hypothesis significance testing, and becoming widely used in many disciplines. Accompanying the book is the Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals (ESCI) package, free software that runs under Excel and is accessible at www.thenewstatistics.com. The book’s exercises use ESCI's simulations, which are highly visual and interactive, to engage users and encourage exploration. Working with the simulations strengthens understanding of key statistical ideas. There are also many examples, and detailed guidance to show readers how to analyze their own data using the new statistics, and practical strategies for interpreting the results. A particular strength of the book is its explanation of meta-analysis, using simple diagrams and examples. Understanding meta-analysis is increasingly important, even at undergraduate levels, because medicine, psychology and many other disciplines now use meta-analysis to assemble the evidence needed for evidence-based practice. The book’s pedagogical program, built on cognitive science principles, reinforces learning: Boxes provide "evidence-based" advice on the most effective statistical techniques. Numerous examples reinforce learning, and show that many disciplines are using the new statistics. Graphs are tied in with ESCI to make important concepts vividly clear and memorable. Opening overviews and end of chapter take-home messages summarize key points. Exercises encourage exploration, deep understanding, and practical applications. This highly accessible book is intended as the core text for any course that emphasizes the new statistics, or as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses in statistics and research methods in departments of psychology, education, human development , nursing, and natural, social, and life sciences. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the new statistics, and future published research, will also appreciate this book. A basic familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed.},

While the former is a well-studied factor in synchronizing behavior and physiology to the earth’s 24-hour rotation, color sensitivity in the regulation of circadian rhythms has not been systematically studied. Drawing on the concept of color opponency, a well-known property of image-forming vision in many vertebrates (including humans), we consider how the spectral shifts during twilight are encoded by a color-opponent sensory system for non-image-forming (NIF) visual functions including phase shifting and melatonin suppression. We review electrophysiological evidence for color sensitivity in the pineal/parietal organs of fish, amphibians and reptiles, color coding in neurons in the circadian pacemaker in mice as well as sporadic evidence for color sensitivity in NIF visual functions in birds and other mammals. Together, these studies suggest that color opponency in may be an important modulator of light-driven physiological and behavioral responses.},

What contribution melanopsin makes to conscious visual perception is less studied. We devised a stimulus that targeted melanopsin separately from the cones using pulsed (3-s) spectral modulations around a photopic background. Pupillometry confirmed that the melanopsin stimulus evokes a response different from that produced by cone stimulation. In each of four subjects, a functional MRI response in area V1 was found. This response scaled with melanopic contrast and was not easily explained by imprecision in the silencing of the cones. Twenty additional subjects then observed melanopsin pulses and provided a structured rating of the perceptual experience. Melanopsin stimulation was described as an unpleasant, blurry, minimal brightening that quickly faded. We conclude that isolated stimulation of melanopsin is likely associated with a response within the cortical visual pathway and with an evoked conscious percept.},

In the present work a series of visual colour rendering investigations are described and their correlation with the current method of calculating colour rendering index as well as with possible updates of the calculation method is evaluated. Visual experiments have shown that the CIE Test Method is not a good predictor of visual perception. A method based on calculating colour differences using the CIECAM02 colour appearance model provides better correlation between visual and calculated colour rendering values.},

This is usually treated as a problem in the wavelength domain, analogous to treating spatial resolution in terms of spatial positions in the image. What is attempted here is a treatment of colour vision in terms of the system's responses to spectral energy distributions that are sinusoidal functions of wavelength. These are called comb-filtered spectra, and the treatment is analogous to that of spatial vision in terms of spatial sinusoids. This gives some insight into the reasons for trichromacy, the advantages of oil droplets, and the narrow separation of the red and green mechanisms. It is also shown that the absorption spectra of photosensitive pigments are superimposable if plotted as a function of the fourth root of wavelength.},

This proposal led to the formation of a CIE committee to consider an ideal version of the system, to be employed either as a supplement to, or an alternative for, the 1931 “standard observer.” After 15 years, the task remains unfinished. The history of debate within the original committee and that of its successor (which is still active today) is briefly reviewed. Among cone fundamentals that might be chosen, a set derived and published by Stockman, MacLeod, and Johnson [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 2491 ( 1993)] is favored here, and some of the advantages for displaying visual data in a system based on these fundamentals are illustrated.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005091},
	abstract = {Background
The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (HK) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this ‘illusion’ to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use fMRI brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related fMRI studies.

Results
Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the HK effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with fMRI.

Conclusions
The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond.},

	abstract = {Despite great efforts over several decades, our best models of primary visual cortex (V1) still predict neural responses quite poorly when probed with natural stimuli, highlighting our limited understanding of the nonlinear computations in V1. At the same time, recent advances in machine learning have shown that deep neural networks can learn highly nonlinear functions for visual information processing. Two approaches based on deep learning have recently been successfully applied to neural data: transfer learning for predicting neural activity in higher areas of the primate ventral stream and data-driven models to predict retina and V1 neural activity of mice. However, so far there exists no comparison between the two approaches and neither of them has been used to model the early primate visual system. Here, we test the ability of both approaches to predict neural responses to natural images in V1 of awake monkeys. We found that both deep learning approaches outperformed classical linear- nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations building on existing V1 encoding theories. On our dataset, transfer learning and data-driven models performed similarly, while the data-driven model employed a much simpler architecture. Thus, multi-layer CNNs set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses to natural images in primate V1. Having such good predictive in-silico models opens the door for quantitative studies of yet unknown nonlinear computations in V1 without being limited by the available experimental time.},

However, the same scene viewed under two different lights with respect to which the same algorithm delivers illuminant estimates and then identical reproductions-and so, the practical estimation error is the same-can, in fact and counterintuitively, result in quite different recovery errors. Reproduction angular error has been recently introduced as an improvement to recovery angular error. The new metric calculates the angle between the RGB values of a white surface corrected by the ground truth illuminant and corrected by the estimated illuminant. Experiments show that illumi-nant estimation algorithms could be ranked differently depending on whether they are evaluated by recovery or reproduction angular error.

Before supplementation, the tests revealed borderline performance for photopic and mesopic visual acuity (VA), functional contrast sensitivity (FCS) and red / green (RG) colour vision. The subject's thresholds for yellow-blue (YB) colour vision and rod sensitivity were, however, just above normal, age-matched limits. Post supplementation, the results revealed increased macular pigment levels in the central retina. In addition, the results also revealed significant improvements in several, other aspects of vision, particularly at lower light levels. VA and FCS improved, but this outcome depended on whether the stimuli were of positive or negative luminance contrast. Rod and cone mediated vision showed significant changes with large improvements in rod sensitivity.

The colour vision of many primates is trichromatic, whereas that of all other mammals is thought to be dichromatic or monochromatic. Moreover, the triplets of cone pigments in different catarrhines (Old World apes and monkeys) are strikingly similar in their spectral positions. We ask whether the selective advantage of trichromacy lies in an enhanced ability to find edible leaves or fruit. Further, we ask whether any factor in these two search tasks has constrained the particular set of cone spectral sensitivities observed in all catarrhines. We measured the spectral properties of the natural environments of six primate species in Uganda: Pan troglodytes, Cercopithecus mitis, Cercopithecus ascanius, Lophocebus albigena, Colobus guereza and Colobus badius. We concentrated on the fruit and leaves in their diets and the leaves of the trees that make up the background against which these diet items must be found. We plotted these measured stimuli in colour spaces appropriate for each primate species, and found that both frugivory and folivory are facilitated by the extra dimension of colour vision found in catarrhines but lacking in most other mammals. Furthermore, by treating the task of searching for food as a signal-detection task, we show that, of all possible combinations of cone sensitivities, the spectral positions of the actual primate pigments are optimal for finding fruit or young leaves against the background of mature leaves. This is because the variance of the chromaticities of the mature leaves is minimised in one channel of the primate's colour vision, so allowing anything that is not a mature leaf to stand out.},

We have measured the reflectance spectra of many samples of fruit eaten by chimpanzees and three frugivorous monkey species. If the fruit are plotted in a colour space appropriate for catarrhine primates, several distinct ripening patterns are evident. The degree of ripeness of many species would be discernible by dichromatic primates, but for most fruit a trichromatic consumer would be at an advantage. However, by calculating which set of possible photopigments would maximise the chromatic distance between samples of each fruit species, we show that the spectral positions of the primate long- (L) and middle-wavelength (M) cone pigments are not optimised for this task.},

Here, with a high-fidelity database of natural stereo-images with groundtruth surface orientation at each pixel, we find dramatic differences in human tilt estimation with natural and artificial stimuli. With artificial stimuli, estimates are precise and unbiased. With natural stimuli, estimates are imprecise and strongly biased. An image-computable normative model grounded in natural scene statistics predicts human bias, precision, and trial-by-trial errors without fitting parameters to the human data. These similarities suggest that the complex human performance patterns with natural stimuli are lawful, and that human visual systems have internalized local image and scene statistics to optimally infer the three-dimensional structure of the environment. The current results help generalize our understanding of human vision from the lab to the real world.},

However, a fraction of color diversity may be explained because some signals are more easily perceived in one environment rather than another. Models show that not only signals but also the perception of signals should regularly evolve in response to different environments, whether these primarily involve detection of conspecifics or detection of predators and prey. Thus, a deeper understanding of how perception of color correlates with environmental attributes should help generate more predictive models of color divergence. Here, I briefly review our understanding of color vision in vertebrates. Then I focus on opsin spectral tuning and opsin expression, two traits involved in color perception that have become amenable to study. I ask how opsin tuning is correlated with ecological differences, notably the light environment, and how this potentially affects perception of conspecific colors. Although opsin tuning appears to evolve slowly, opsin expression levels are more evolutionarily labile but have been difficult to connect to color perception. The challenge going forward will be to identify how physiological differences involved in color vision, such as opsin expression levels, translate into perceptual differences, the selection pressures that have driven those differences, and ultimately how this may drive evolution of conspecific colors.},

However, despite anatomical and physiological evidence that they contribute to the thalamocortical visual projection [ 5–7 ], no aspect of visual discrimination has been shown to rely upon ipRGCs. Based on their currently known roles, we hypothesized that ipRGCs may contribute to distinguishing brightness. This percept is related to an object's luminance—a photometric measure of light intensity relevant for cone photoreceptors. However, the perceived brightness of different sources is not always predicted by their respective luminance [ 8–12 ]. Here, we used parallel behavioral and electrophysiological experiments to first show that melanopsin contributes to brightness discrimination in both retinally degenerate and fully sighted mice. We continued to use comparable paradigms in psychophysical experiments to provide evidence for a similar role in healthy human subjects. These data represent the first direct evidence that an aspect of visual discrimination in normally sighted subjects can be supported by inner retinal photoreceptors.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The human visual system encodes color by comparing the responses of three different kinds of photoreceptors: the long- (reddish), medium- (greenish), and short- (bluish) wavelength-sensitive cone cells. In order for the visual system to accurately represent the color of stimuli, it must (in effect) know the class of the cone that produced each response. The long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive cones, however, are virtually identical in every known way except that their responses to a given spectrum of light differ. Here, we simulate cones in a model human retina and show that by examining the correlation of the responses of cones to natural scenes, it is possible to determine both the number cone classes present in a retinal mosaic and to explicitly determine the class of each cone. These findings shed light on the computational mechanisms that may have enabled the evolution of human color vision, as well as on the more general question of whether and when it is possible for sensory systems to self-organize.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Photopic vision arises from L, M and S cones as well as from the recently discovered intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing the photopigment melanopsin. Much is known about the brain pathways of signals originating from cones. Considerably less is known about the projections of the ipRGCs, in particular in the human brain. Here we used BOLD fMRI to measure neural responses in humans to spectral modulations that selectively target melanopsin while minimizing the responses of the cones, and compare these to responses generated using cone-targeted spectral modulations.

Methods: Four observers viewed large-field (27.5° diameter, central 5° obscured) sinusoidal flicker (1-16 Hz, log spaced) at 470 cd/m2 during BOLD fMRI. Using the method of silent substitution and a digital light synthesizer, spectral modulations were directed at melanopsin, L+M, L-M, or S cones. An isochromatic modulation (L+M+S+melanopsin) was also studied. Estimates of photopigment spectral sensitivities used to produce modulations accounted for observer age and stimulus extent. Anatomical regions of interest were defined for the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; using volumetric templates), for primary visual cortex (V1) and for extrastriate areas (V2, V3 and hV4) (Benson VSS2013). Cortical voxels were restricted to {\textgreater}5° eccentricity as an extra precaution against contamination from changes in cone spectral sensitivity at the fovea. Temporal transfer functions (TTFs), describing the BOLD response as a function of temporal frequency for each modulation direction, were averaged for the four observers.

Results: We found robust melanopsin-driven responses in both LGN and V1-hV4. In LGN, the melanopsin response was bandpass, maximal at 8 Hz with no measurable response below 2 Hz. The melanopsin response in V1 and V2 through hV4 was also bandpass. Across areas the responses to cone-directed stimuli differed with the direction of the spectral modulation, and differed as well from the responses to melanopsin stimulation. S-cone responses were distinct from melanopsin responses in both LGN and cortex.

Conclusions: Signals originating in the melanopsin-containing ipRGCs produce robust responses in the LGN and visual cortex of the human brain. The TTFs for melanopsin-driven responses are bandpass in both LGN and visual cortex. The responses tomelanopsin-driven stimulation have a temporal signature distinct from that of cone-driven responses.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of visual coding have been successfully predicted by starting from the statistics of natural scenes and then asking how the stimulus could be efficiently represented. We started from the representation of color characterized by uniform color spaces, and then asked what type of color environment they implied. These spaces are designed to represent equal perceptual differences in color discrimination or appearance by equal distances in the space. The relative sensitivity to different axes within the space might therefore reflect the gamut of colors in natural scenes. To examine this, we projected perceptually uniform distributions within the Munsell, CIE L*u*v* or CIE L*a*b* spaces into cone-opponent space. All were elongated along a bluish-yellowish axis reflecting covarying signals along the L–M and S–(L+M) cardinal axes, a pattern typical (though not identical) to many natural environments. In turn, color distributions from environments were more uniform when projected into the CIE L*a*b* perceptual space than when represented in a normalized cone-opponent space. These analyses suggest the bluish-yellowish bias in environmental colors might be an important factor shaping chromatic sensitivity, and also suggest that perceptually uniform color metrics could be derived from natural scene statistics and potentially tailored to specific environments.},

The resulting clear-sky chromaticities in 44 different view directions (1) are close to but do not coincide with the CIE daylight locus, (2) form V-shaped meridional chromaticity curves along it (as expected from theory), and (3) have correlated color temperatures (CCT’s) ranging from 3800 K to ∞ K. We also routinely observe that sky color and luminance are asymmetric about the solar meridian, usually perceptibly so. A principal-components analysis shows that three vectors are required for accurate clear-sky colorimetry, whereas six are needed for spectral analyses.},

Chromatic sensitivity (in cone contrast coordinates) is about 7 times higher than luminance sensitivity in the fovea but falls faster with eccentricity, so that luminance and chromatic sensitivities are similar at eccentricities of 20° or less. At eccentricities greater than about 14°, there is a clear asymmetry wherein green chromatic flashes are considerably less detectable than red ones. By measuring complete detection contours for many ratios of incremental and decremental red and green flashes, we isolated the red and green chromatic detection mechanisms, and demonstrated that the red-green asymmetry is not a property of the L- or M-cone response per se, but rather is a property of the post-receptoral, chromatic mechanisms. The peripheral luminance and chromatic mechanisms could be further separated with a suprathreshold luminance flash (a pedestal), since an intense pedestal masks coincident luminance test flashes but facilitates the chromatic flashes. The luminance pedestal approximately linearizes the chromatic detection function (the psychometric function).},

	abstract = {Summary
Human visual perception is both stable and adaptive. Perception of complex objects, such as faces, is shaped by the long-term average of experience as well as immediate, comparative context. Measurements of brain activity have demonstrated corresponding neural mechanisms, including norm-based responses reflective of stored prototype representations, and adaptation induced by the immediately preceding stimulus. Here, we consider the possibility that these apparently separate phenomena can arise from a single mechanism of sensory integration operating over varying timescales. We used fMRI to measure neural responses from the fusiform gyrus while subjects observed a rapid stream of face stimuli. Neural activity at this cortical site was best explained by the integration of sensory experience over multiple sequential stimuli, following a decaying-exponential weighting function. Although this neural activity could be mistaken for immediate neural adaptation or long-term, norm-based responses, it in fact reflected a timescale of integration intermediate to both. We then examined the timescale of sensory integration across the cortex. We found a gradient that ranged from rapid sensory integration in early visual areas, to long-term, stable representations in higher-level, ventral-temporal cortex. These findings were replicated with a new set of face stimuli and subjects. Our results suggest that a cascade of visual areas integrate sensory experience, transforming highly adaptable responses at early stages to stable representations at higher levels.},

Abstract
Purpose:  A recent study has shown that retinal ganglion cells containing the photopigment melanopsin, which are intrinsically photosensitive in primates, project to the pupillary control centre in the pretectum. The aim of this study was to investigate how melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) contribute to the pupillary pathway.Methods:  We designed and built a novel multi-primary stimulation system to control stimulation of the three cone types and mRGCs independently in the human eye. We measured the latency and amplitude of transient pupillary responses to three types of test stimuli modulating excitations of mRGCs and cones (mRGC, luminance and the light flux stimuli).Results:  It was found that the transient pupillary response to mRGC stimuli has a longer latency than that to luminance and the light flux stimuli when an onset of sinusoidal stimulus was used.Conclusions:  The results indicate that we successfully demonstrated the pupillary response to mRGCs under conditions where mRGCs are isolated in humans. Furthermore, the data confirm that the delayed response disappeared when the stimulus is presented as a square-wave pulse and not weighted by a sinusoid. The similarity of time courses for the earlier phase of pupillary responses to all stimuli suggested that these transient pupillary responses were driven by a single mechanism, which is perhaps associated with cone-mediated signals.},

Signals from cones are combined both additively and in opposition to create the perception of overall light and color. Similar mechanisms seem to be at work in the control of the pupil’s response to light. Uncharacterized however, is the relative contribution of melanopsin and S cones, with their overlapping, short-wavelength spectral sensitivities. We measured the response of the human pupil to the separate stimulation of the cones and melanopsin at a range of temporal frequencies under photopic conditions. The S-cone and melanopsin photoreceptor channels were found to be low-pass, in contrast to a band-pass response of the pupil to L- and M-cone signals. An examination of the phase relationships of the evoked responses revealed that melanopsin signals add with signals from L and M cones but are opposed by signals from S cones in control of the pupil. The opposition of the S cones is revealed in a seemingly paradoxical dilation of the pupil to greater S-cone photon capture. This surprising result is explained by the neurophysiological properties of ipRGCs found in animal studies.},

	abstract = {In mammals, a small population of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) plays a key role in the regulation of nonvisual photic responses, such as behavioral responses to light, pineal melatonin synthesis, pupillary light reflex, and sleep latency. These ipRGCs also express melanopsin (Opn4), a putative opsin-family photopigment that has been shown to play a role in mediating these nonvisual photic responses. Melanopsin is required for the function of this inner retinal pathway, but its precise role in generating photic responses has not yet been determined. We found that expression of melanopsin in Xenopus oocytes results in light-dependent activation of membrane currents through the Gαq/Gα11 G protein pathway, with an action spectrum closely matching that of melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs and of behavioral responses to light in mice lacking rods and cones. When coexpressed with arrestins, melanopsin could use all-trans-retinaldehyde as a chromophore, which suggests that it may function as a bireactive opsin. We also found that melanopsin could activate the cation channel TRPC3, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila phototransduction channels TRP and TRPL. Melanopsin therefore signals more like an invertebrate opsin than like a classical vertebrate rod-and-cone opsin.
In mammals, the opsin that detects light for circadian rhythms and pupil constriction activates signaling pathways that are similar to those used in invertebrates for vision.

In the conventional view of retinal physiology, rods and cones were assumed to be the only photoreceptors in the eye and were, therefore, considered responsible for non-image processing. However, signals from mRGCs contribute to this non-image forming processing along with cone-mediated luminance signals; although both signals contribute, it is unclear how these signals are summed. We designed and built a novel multi-primary stimulation system to stimulate mRGCs independently of other photoreceptors using a silent-substitution technique within a bright steady background. The system allows direct measurements of pupillary functions for mRGCs and cones. We observed a significant change in steady-state pupil diameter when we varied the excitation of mRGC alone, with no change in luminance and colour. Furthermore, the change in pupil diameter induced by mRGCs was larger than that induced by a variation in luminance alone: that is, for a bright steady background, the mRGC signals contribute to the pupillary pathway by a factor of three times more than the L- and M-cone signals.},

It is unknown if ipRGC activity is subject to extrinsic (central) or intrinsic (retinal) network-mediated circadian modulation during light entrainment and phase shifting. Eleven younger persons (18–30 years) with no ophthalmological, medical or sleep disorders participated. The activity of the inner (ipRGC) and outer retina (cone photoreceptors) was assessed hourly using the pupil light reflex during a 24 h period of constant environmental illumination (10 lux). Exogenous circadian cues of activity, sleep, posture, caffeine, ambient temperature, caloric intake and ambient illumination were controlled. Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) was determined from salivary melatonin assay at hourly intervals, and participant melatonin onset values were set to 14 h to adjust clock time to circadian time. Here we demonstrate in humans that the ipRGC controlled post-illumination pupil response has a circadian rhythm independent of external light cues. This circadian variation precedes melatonin onset and the minimum ipRGC driven pupil response occurs post melatonin onset. Outer retinal photoreceptor contributions to the inner retinal ipRGC driven post-illumination pupil response also show circadian variation whereas direct outer retinal cone inputs to the pupil light reflex do not, indicating that intrinsically photosensitive (melanopsin) retinal ganglion cells mediate this circadian variation.},

The temporal properties of intrinsic ipRGC signalling are distinct to those of rods and cones, including longer latencies and sustained signalling after light offset. We examined whether the melanopsin mediated post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) and pupil constriction were dependent upon the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between successive light pulses and the temporal frequency of sinusoidal light stimuli. Melanopsin excitation was altered by variation of stimulus wavelength (464nm and 638nm lights) and irradiance (11.4 and 15.2logphotonscm−2s−1). We found that 6s PIPR amplitude was independent of ISI and temporal frequency for all melanopsin excitation levels, indicating complete summation. In contrast to the PIPR, the maximum pupil constriction increased with increasing ISI with high and low melanopsin excitation, but time to minimum diameter was slower with high melanopsin excitation only. This melanopsin response to briefly presented pulses (16 and 100ms) slows the temporal response of the maximum pupil constriction. We also demonstrate that high melanopsin excitation attenuates the phasic peak-trough pupil amplitude compared to conditions with low melanopsin excitation, indicating an interaction between inner and outer retinal inputs to the pupil light reflex. We infer that outer retina summation is important for rapidly controlling pupil diameter in response to short timescale fluctuations in illumination and may occur at two potential sites, one that is presynaptic to extrinsic photoreceptor input to ipRGCs, or another within the pupil control pathway if ipRGCs have differential temporal tuning to extrinsic and intrinsic signalling.},

However, the photoreceptor contributions to the early redilation phase of the PIPR ({\textless} 6 s post-stimulus) have not been reported. Here, we evaluated the photoreceptor contributions to the early phase PIPR (0.6 s to 5.0 s) by measuring the spectral sensitivity of the criterion PIPR amplitude in response to 1 s light pulses at five narrowband stimulus wavelengths (409, 464, 508, 531 and 592 nm). The retinal irradiance producing a criterion PIPR was normalised to the peak and fitted by either a single photopigment nomogram or the combined melanopsin and rhodopsin spectral nomograms with the +L+M cone photopic luminous efficiency (Vλ) function. We show that the PIPR spectral sensitivity at times ≥ 1.7 s after light offset is best described by the melanopsin nomogram. At times {\textless} 1.7 s, the peak PIPR sensitivity shifts to longer wavelengths (range: 482 to 498 nm) and is best described by the combined photoreceptor nomogram, with major contributions from melanopsin and rhodopsin. This first report of melanopsin and rhodopsin contributions to the early phase PIPR is in line with the electrophysiological findings of ipRGC and rod signalling after the cessation of light stimuli and provides a cut-off time for isolating photoreceptor specific function in healthy and diseased eyes.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms of light adaptation have been traditionally explained with reference to psychophysical experimentation. However, the neural substrata involved in those mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Our study analyzed links between psychophysical measurements and retinal physiological evidence with consideration for the phenomena of rod-cone interactions, photon noise, and spatial summation. Threshold test luminances were obtained with steady background fields at mesopic and photopic light levels (i.e., 0.06–110cd/m2) for retinal eccentricities from 0° to 15° using three combinations of background/test field sizes (i.e., 10°/2°, 10°/0.45°, and 1°/0.45°). A two-channel Maxwellian view optical system was employed to eliminate pupil effects on the measured thresholds. A model based on visual mechanisms that were described in the literature was optimized to fit the measured luminance thresholds in all experimental conditions. Our results can be described by a combination of visual mechanisms. We determined how spatial summation changed with eccentricity and how subtractive adaptation changed with eccentricity and background field size. According to our model, photon noise plays a significant role to explain contrast detection thresholds measured with the 1/0.45° background/test size combination at mesopic luminances and at off-axis eccentricities. In these conditions, our data reflect the presence of rod-cone interaction for eccentricities between 6° and 9° and luminances between 0.6 and 5cd/m2. In spite of the increasing noise effects with eccentricity, results also show that the visual system tends to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio in the off-axis detection task over the whole mesopic range.},

Assessing color vision using an easily accessible and portable test may help in the self-monitoring of vision-related changes in ocular/systemic conditions and assist in the early detection of disease processes. Tablet computer-based games were developed with different levels of gamification as a more portable option to assess chromatic contrast sensitivity. Game 1 was designed as a clinical version with no gaming elements. Game 2 was a gamified version of game 1 (added fun elements: feedback, scores, and sounds) and game 3 was a complete game with vision task nested within. The current study aimed to determine the normative values and evaluate repeatability of the tablet computer-based games in comparison with an established test, the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) Trivector test. Normally sighted individuals [N = 100, median (range) age 19.0 years (18–56 years)] had their chromatic contrast sensitivity evaluated binocularly using the three games and the CCT. Games 1 and 2 and the CCT showed similar absolute thresholds and tolerance intervals, and game 3 had significantly lower values than games 1, 2, and the CCT, due to visual task differences. With the exception of game 3 for blue-yellow, the CCT and tablet computer-based games showed similar repeatability with comparable 95\% limits of agreement. The custom-designed games are portable, rapid, and may find application in routine clinical practice, especially for testing younger populations.},

The current study aimed to understand how gamification affects the user experience, specifically during the undertaking of psychophysical tasks designed to estimate vision thresholds (chromatic and achromatic contrast sensitivity). Methods: Three tablet computer-based games were developed with three levels of gaming elements. Game 1 was designed to be a simple clinical test (no gaming elements), game 2 was similar to game 1 but with added gaming elements (i.e., feedback, scores, and sounds), and game 3 was a complete game. Participants (N = 144, age: 9.9–42 years) played three games in random order. The user experience for each game was assessed using a Short Feedback Questionnaire. Results: The median (interquartile range) fun level for the three games was 2.5 (1.6), 3.9 (1.7), and 2.5 (2.8), respectively. Overall, participants reported greater fun level and higher preparedness to play the game again for game 2 than games 1 and 3 (P {\textless} 0.05). There were significant positive correlations observed between fun level and preparedness to play the game again for all the games (p {\textless} 0.05). Engagement (assessed as completion rates) did not differ between the games. Conclusion: Gamified version (game 2) was preferred to the other two versions. Over the short term, the careful application of gaming elements to vision tests was found to increase the fun level of users, without affecting engagement with the vision test.},

	abstract = {Colors defined by the two intermediate directions in color space, “orange–cyan” and “lime–magenta,” elicit the same spatiotemporal average response from the two cardinal chromatic channels in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). While we found LGN functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to these pairs of colors were statistically indistinguishable, primary visual cortex (V1) fMRI responses were stronger to orange–cyan. Moreover, linear combinations of single-cell responses to cone-isolating stimuli of V1 cone-opponent cells also yielded stronger predicted responses to orange–cyan over lime–magenta, suggesting these neurons underlie the fMRI result. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that V1 recombines LGN signals into “higher-order” mechanisms tuned to noncardinal color directions. In light of work showing that natural images and daylight samples are biased toward orange–cyan, our findings further suggest that V1 is adapted to daylight. V1, especially double-opponent cells, may function to extract spatial information from color boundaries correlated with scene-structure cues, such as shadows lit by ambient blue sky juxtaposed with surfaces reflecting sunshine.},

Here we used immunohistochemistry to study the morphology, density, distribution, and synaptic connectivity of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in four post mortem human donor retinas. Two types of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells were distinguished based on their dendritic stratification near either the outer or the inner border of the inner plexiform layer. Outer stratifying cells make up on average 60\% of the melanopsin-expressing cells. About half of the melanopsin-expressing cells (or 80\% of the outer stratifying cells) have their soma displaced to the inner nuclear layer. Inner stratifying cells have their soma exclusively in the ganglion cell layer and include a small proportion of bistratified cells. The dendritic field diameter of melanopsin-expressing cells ranges from 250 (near the fovea) to 1,000 µm in peripheral retina. The dendritic trees of outer stratifying cells cover the retina independent of soma location. The dendritic fields of both outer and inner stratifying cells show a high degree of overlap with a coverage factor of approximately two. Melanopsin-expressing cells occur at an average peak density of between ∼20 and ∼40 cells/mm2 at about 2 mm eccentricity, the density drops to below ∼10 cells/mm2 at about 8 mm eccentricity. Both the outer and inner stratifying dendrites express postsynaptic density (PSD95) immunoreactive puncta suggesting that they receive synaptic input from bipolar cells.},

The current study investigates whether relationships of luminance and chromaticity in the natural environment could drive chromatic adaptation independently and differently for bright and dark colors. This is motivated by psychophysical evidence of systematic difference shifts in red–green chromatic sensitivities between contextually bright- versus dark-colored stimuli. For some broad classes of scene content, consistent shifts in chromaticity are found between high and low light levels within images. Especially in those images in which sky and terrain are juxtaposed, this shift has direction and magnitude consistent with the observed psychophysical shifts in the red–green balance between bright and dark colors. Taken together, these findings suggest that relative weighting of M- and L-cone signals could be adapted, in a luminance-dependent fashion, to regularities in the natural environment.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the light sensitivity of poorly reflective cones observed in retinas of normal subjects, and to establish a relationship between cone reflectivity and perceptual threshold.
METHODS: Five subjects (four male, one female) with normal vision were imaged longitudinally (7-26 imaging sessions, representing 82-896 days) using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to monitor cone reflectance. Ten cones with unusually low reflectivity, as well as 10 normally reflective cones serving as controls, were targeted for perceptual testing. Cone-sized stimuli were delivered to the targeted cones and luminance increment thresholds were quantified. Thresholds were measured three to five times per session for each cone in the 10 pairs, all located 2.2 to 3.3° from the center of gaze.
RESULTS: Compared with other cones in the same retinal area, three of 10 monitored dark cones were persistently poorly reflective, while seven occasionally manifested normal reflectance. Tested psychophysically, all 10 dark cones had thresholds comparable with those from normally reflecting cones measured concurrently (P = 0.49). The variation observed in dark cone thresholds also matched the wide variation seen in a large population (n = 56 cone pairs, six subjects) of normal cones; in the latter, no correlation was found between cone reflectivity and threshold (P = 0.0502).
CONCLUSIONS: Low cone reflectance cannot be used as a reliable indicator of cone sensitivity to light in normal retinas. To improve assessment of early retinal pathology, other diagnostic criteria should be employed along with imaging and cone-based microperimetry.},

The preferred light settings identified in these studies, however, had high values of colour fidelity and colour gamut. It has been speculated that the preference was caused by good colour rendition, rather than chromaticity. This article reports a pilot study in which the spectral power distributions of the light settings were carefully designed using a genetic algorithm. Twenty-three observers evaluated pairs of light settings at 3000 K and 6500 K with different chromaticities, in terms of Duv, but similar colour rendition as characterized using the IES TM-30-15 Rf, Rg, and Color Vector Graphic. It was found that the light settings with Duv of −0.02 and −0.03 were most preferred among the 3000 K settings; while the settings with Duv of 0 and −0.01 were most preferred among the 6500 K settings. Further studies regarding how chromaticity alone affects preference under different viewing conditions and adaptation conditions will be valuable to better understand human preference for light stimuli.},

	abstract = {Colour preference for lighting is generally influenced by three kinds of contextual factors, the light, the object and the observer. In this study, a series of psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate and compare the effect of certain factors on colour preference, including spectral power distribution of light, lighting application, observers’ personal colour preference, regional cultural difference and gender difference. LED lights with different correlated colour temperatures were used to illuminate a wide selection of objects. Participant response was quantified by a 7-point rating method or a 5-level ranking method. It was found that the preferred illumination for different objects exhibited a similar trend and that the influence of light was significantly stronger than that of other factors. Therefore, we conclude that the light itself (rather than, e.g. the objects that are viewed) is the most crucial factor for predicting which light, among several candidates with different correlated colour temperatures, an observer will prefer. In addition, some of the gamut-based colour quality metrics correlated well with the participants’ response, which corroborates the view that colour preference is strongly influenced by colour saturation. The familiarity of the object affects the ratings for each experiment while the colour of the objects also influences colour preference.},

	abstract = {A red/green equilibrium light is one which appears neither reddish nor greenish (i.e. either uniquely yellow, uniquely blue, or achromatic). A subset of spectral and nonspectral red/green equilibria was determined for several luminance levels, in order to test whether the set of all such equilibria is closed under linear color-mixture operations.
The spectral loci of equilibrium yellow and blue showed either no variation or visually insignificant variation over a range of 1–2 log10 unit. There were no trends that were repeatable across observers. We concluded that spectral red/green equilibria are closed under scalar multiplication; consequently they are invariant hues relative to the Bezold-Brücke shift.
The additive mixture of yellow and blue equilibrium wavelengths, in any luminance ratio, is also an equilibrium light. Small changes of the yellowish component of a mixture toward redness or greeness must be compensated by predictable changes of the bluish component of the mixture toward greenness or redness. We concluded that yellow and blue equilibria are complementary relative to an equilibrium white; that desaturation of a yellow or blue equilibrium light with such a white produces no Abney hue shift; and that the set of red/green equilibria is closed under general linear operations.
One consequence is that the red/green chromatic-response function, measured by the Jameson-Hurvich technique of cancellation to equilibrium, is a linear function of the individual's color-matching coordinates. A second consequence of linear closure of equilibria is a strong constraint on the class of combination rules by which receptor outputs are recoded into the red/green opponent process.},

	abstract = {Summary
Melanopsin photoreception enhances retinal responses to variations in ambient light (irradiance) and drives non-image-forming visual reflexes such as circadian entrainment [1–6]. Melanopsin signals also reach brain regions responsible for form vision [7–9], but melanopsin’s contribution, if any, to encoding visual images remains unclear. We addressed this deficit using principles of receptor silent substitution to present images in which visibility for melanopsin versus rods+cones was independently modulated, and we recorded evoked responses in the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN; thalamic relay for cortical vision). Approximately 20\% of dLGN units responded to patterns visible only to melanopsin, revealing that melanopsin signals alone can convey spatial information. Spatial receptive fields (RFs) mapped using melanopsin-isolating stimuli had ON centers with diameters ∼13°. Melanopsin and rod+cone responses differed in the temporal domain, and responses to slow changes in radiance (\&lt;0.9 Hz) and stationary images were deficient when stimuli were rendered invisible for melanopsin. We employed these data to devise and test a mathematical model of melanopsin’s involvement in form vision and applied it, along with further experimental recordings, to explore melanopsin signals under simulated active view of natural scenes. Our findings reveal that melanopsin enhances the thalamic representation of scenes containing local correlations in radiance, compensating for the high temporal frequency bias of cone vision and the negative correlation between magnitude and frequency for changes in direction of view. Together, these data reveal a distinct melanopsin contribution to encoding visual images, predicting that, under natural view, melanopsin augments the early visual system’s ability to encode patterns over moderate spatial scales.},

What contribution melanopsin makes to conscious visual perception is less studied. We devised a stimulus that targeted melanopsin separately from the cones using pulsed (3 s) spectral modulations around a photopic background. Pupillometry confirmed that the melanopsin stimulus drives a retinal mechanism distinct from luminance. In each of four subjects, a functional MRI response in area V1 was found. This response scaled with melanopic contrast and was not easily explained by imprecision in the silencing of the cones. Twenty additional subjects then observed melanopsin pulses and provided a structured rating of the perceptual experience. Melanopsin stimulation was described as an unpleasant, blurry, minimal brightening that quickly faded. We conclude that isolated stimulation of melanopsin is likely associated with a response within the cortical visual pathway and with an evoked conscious percept.},

Recent work on both the anchoring problem and the problem of errors has produced a new model of lightness perception, one that is qualitatively different from the intrinsic image models. The new model, which is based on a combination of local and global anchoring of lightness values, appears to provide an unprecedented account of a wide range of empirical results, both classical and recent, especially the pattern of errors.

	abstract = {Two psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of colour gamut size and shape on colour preference. In the first, two side-by-side booths were designed to resemble a retail setting with clothing; in the second, a single booth was designed to resemble a restaurant setting, but also included a mirror to permit the observer's evaluation of skin tone. These settings were illuminated with two sets of sources, where, compared to a fixed reference, one set created modest chroma enhancement and the other set created greater increases in object chroma. Within each set, gamut shape varied, meaning different hues were saturated, even though, on average, the spectra created the same average increase in chroma. When objects were unfamiliar, as with the fabrics, all chroma-enhancing spectra were preferred to the fixed reference regardless of the gamut shapes. When familiar objects were present, such as food, observers were more discerning about changes in chroma and hue. We conclude that a graphic of gamut shape is an important adjunct to average measures of colour fidelity and gamut.},

This result has surprised us since we have previously used the better of these algorithms successfully to correct the colour balance of images for display. Colour balancing has been the typical application of colour constancy, rarely has it been actually put to use in a computer vision system, so our goal was to show how well the various methods would do on an obvious machine colour vision task, namely, object recognition. Although all the colour constancy methods we tested proved insufficient for the task, we consider this an important finding in itself. In addition we present results showing the correlation between colour constancy performance and object recognition performance, and as one might expect, the better the colour constancy the better the recognition rate.},

When this system of discs is set in rapid rotation, the sectors of the different colours become indistinguishable, and the whole appears of one uniform tint. The resultant tints of two different combinations of colours may be compared by using a second set of discs of a smaller size, and placing these over the centre of the first set, so as to leave the outer portion of the larger discs exposed. The resultant tint of the first combination will then appear in a ring round that of the second, and may be very carefully compared with it.},

Introduced and given specific attention here is the particular procedure wherein the stimulus-energy vector is premultiplied by A(A′ A)-1A′, A being any matrix of experimentally established color-mixture data with three linearly independent columns (primaries). This computation provides the fundamental metamer (as we shall call it) of the visual stimulus being analyzed. The difference between the stimulus-energy distribution and the fundamental metameric function provides the metameric black function. Examples of both types of functions are given and discussed.},

	abstract = {In 1819, Johann Purkinje described how a moving light source that displaces the shadow of the retinal blood vessels to adjacent cones can produce the entopic percept of a branching tree. Here, we describe a novel method for producing a similar percept. We used a device that mixes 56 narrowband primaries under computer control, in conjunction with the method of silent substitution, to present observers with a spectral modulation that selectively targeted penumbral cones in the shadow of the retinal blood vessels. Such a modulation elicits a clear Purkinje-tree percept. We show that the percept is specific to penumbral L and M cone stimulation and is not produced by selective penumbral S cone stimulation. The Purkinje-tree percept was strongest at 16 Hz and fell off at lower (8 Hz) and higher (32 Hz) temporal frequencies. Selective stimulation of open-field cones that are not in shadow, with penumbral cones silenced, also produced the percept, but it was not seen when penumbral and open-field cones were modulated together. This indicates the need for spatial contrast between penumbral and open-field cones to create the Purkinje-tree percept. Our observation provides a new means for studying the response of retinally stabilized images and demonstrates that penumbral cones can support spatial vision. Further, the result illustrates a way in which silent substitution techniques can fail to be silent. We show that inadvertent penumbral cone stimulation can accompany melanopsin-directed modulations that are designed only to silence open-field cones. This in turn can result in visual responses that might be mistaken as melanopsin-driven.},

	abstract = {Signals from cones are recombined in postreceptoral channels [luminance, L + M; red-green, L − M; blue-yellow, S − (L + M)]. The melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are also active at daytime light levels and recent psychophysical results suggest that melanopsin contributes to conscious vision in humans. Here, we measured BOLD fMRI responses to spectral modulations that separately targeted the postreceptoral cone channels and melanopsin. Responses to spatially uniform (27.5° field size, central 5° obscured) flicker at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 Hz were recorded from areas V1, V2/V3, motion-sensitive area MT, and the lateral occipital complex. In V1 and V2/V3, higher temporal sensitivity was observed to L + M + S (16 Hz) compared with L − M flicker (8 Hz), consistent with psychophysical findings. Area MT was most sensitive to rapid (32 Hz) flicker of either L + M + S or L − M. We found S cone responses only in areas V1 and V2/V3 (peak frequency: 4–8 Hz). In addition, we studied an L + M modulation and found responses that were effectively identical at all temporal frequencies to those recorded for the L + M + S modulation. Finally, we measured the cortical response to melanopsin-directed flicker and compared this response with control modulations that addressed stimulus imprecision and the possibility of stimulation of cones in the shadow of retinal blood vessels (penumbral cones). For our stimulus conditions, melanopsin flicker did not elicit a cortical response exceeding that of the control modulations. We note that failure to control for penumbral cone stimulation could be mistaken for a melanopsin response.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The retina contains cone photoreceptors and ganglion cells that contain the photopigment melanopsin. Cones provide brightness and color signals to visual cortex. Melanopsin influences circadian rhythm and the pupil, but its contribution to cortex and perception is less clear. We measured the response of human visual cortex with fMRI using spectral modulations tailored to stimulate the cones and melanopsin separately. We found that cortical responses to cone signals vary systematically across visual areas. Differences in temporal sensitivity for achromatic, red-green, and blue-yellow stimuli generally reflect the known perceptual properties of vision. We found that melanopsin signals do not produce a measurable response in visual cortex at temporal frequencies between 0.5 and 64 Hz at daytime light levels.},

	abstract = {Human brightness perception is the result of at least three visual channels: The achromatic luminance channel, the red-green (R-G) color opponent channel and the blue-yellow (B-Y) color opponent channel. Short-wavelength output of light sources enhances brightness perception for stimuli subtending large visual angles in the low-to-moderate photopic range ({\textasciitilde}2 lux - {\textasciitilde}150 lux). This is partially explained by a contribution of short-wavelength (S) cones. Recent evidence from experiments conducted with mice as well as humans suggests that intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing the photopigment melanopsin might also underlie increased short-wavelength spectral sensitivity of human brightness perception. The objective of the present thesis was to investigate whether melanopsin could be contributing directly to human scene brightness perception. Two experimental investigations of the relative potential contribution of S-cones (B-Y opponent color channel) and ipRGCs to scene brightness at 6 light levels between 2 lux and 150 lux were conducted. Subjects provided forced-choice brightness judgments and relative brightness magnitude judgments at two light level ranges, with two different stimuli presented sequentially in counterbalanced order. Experiment 1 used a "Green" stimulus composed of LED illumination peaking at 525 nm and 625 nm, and a "Fuchsia" stimulus composed of LEDs peaking at 465 nm and 625 nm. S-cone stimulation from the Green stimulus was only 10\% of that from the Fuchsia stimulus, melanopsin stimulation however was substantial (for both stimuli). The hypothesis was therefore that Green would be perceived as brighter than predicted by a provisional brightness model developed by Rea et al. (2011) that only takes into account cone responses, and not melanopsin. Experiment 2 used two "Amber" stimuli, one composed of an LED with peak output at 599 nm (Amber 1), and another composed of LEDs peaking at 520 nm and 635 nm (Amber 2). While both stimuli had negligible S-cone stimulation, Amber 2 did stimulate melanopsin 8 times more than Amber 1 for the same photopic light level. The hypothesis was therefore that if melanopsin were to contribute to brightness perception, Amber 2 would be perceived as brighter than Amber 1. Brightness judgments for the stimuli with higher potential for melanopsin stimulation were indeed higher in both experiments than would be predicted if S-cones were the only short-wavelength-sensitive mechanism contributing to brightness perception, thus supporting the possibility of melanopsin contribution. Post hoc analysis using data from Experiment 1 and 2, and utilizing previously published (in 2011 and 2013) provisional brightness models as a foundation, showed that the data could be fitted well by modifying the relative S-cone contribution in the equations and including a melanopsin coefficient that increased relative to an increase in light level. This refined model also predicted results from prior experiments. The improvements between this new model and the 2011 model were relatively large, while they were not as large in comparison with the previous 2013 model. The ability to quantify and predict scene brightness perception evoked by a particular light source opens up the possibility of optimizing lighting solutions for maximum brightness and minimum energy usage. Brightness appears to be related to pedestrians' perceived security in night-time outdoor spaces; thus brightness as a metric becomes a meaningful criterion for outdoor lighting.},

	abstract = {On several paintings by artists of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th Century a darkening of the original yellow areas, painted with the chrome yellow pigment (PbCrO4, PbCrO4·xPbSO4, or PbCrO4·xPbO) is observed. The most famous of these are the various Sunflowers paintings Vincent van Gogh made during his career. In the first part of this work, we attempt to elucidate the degradation process of chrome yellow by studying artificially aged model samples. In view of the very thin (1−3 μm) alteration layers that are formed, high lateral resolution spectroscopic methods such as microscopic X-ray absorption near edge (μ-XANES), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-XRF), and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) were employed. Some of these use synchrotron radiation (SR). Additionally, microscopic SR X-ray diffraction (SR μ-XRD), μ-Raman, and mid-FTIR spectroscopy were employed to completely characterize the samples. The formation of Cr(III) compounds at the surface of the chrome yellow paint layers is particularly observed in one aged model sample taken from a historic paint tube (ca. 1914). About two-thirds of the chromium that is present at the surface has reduced from the hexavalent to the trivalent state. The EELS and μ-XANES spectra are consistent with the presence of Cr2O3·2H2O (viridian). Moreover, as demonstrated by μ-XANES, the presence of another Cr(III) compound, such as either Cr2(SO4)3·H2O or (CH3CO2)7Cr3(OH)2 [chromium(III) acetate hydroxide], is likely.},

	abstract = {Little scientific evidence is available to document the state of museum exhibition lighting regarding occupant and decision maker needs or the mismatches (disparities) between needs and "reality" which exist in actual settings. Without knowledge of constituent needs or of the existing situation, decision making is ineffective and improvement is unlikely.
Building diagnostics provides a framework for this project. The diagnostic process serves as an essential link in more closely matching building performance stated needs with "reality" (perceived and existing physical conditions).
This work provides the essential research base for architectural decision making and formulation of appropriate strategies to improve museum lighting performance. First, needs of various constituencies are determined, then the problems associated with perceived and instrument measured "reality" are identified, and finally the mismatches between need and "reality" are highlighted.
The study included a survey of 130 museum personnel and lighting designers and 427 museum visitors to determine the needs of these constituencies. The current status of exhibition lighting was assessed via a comprehensive evaluation using both objective (instrument-based) and subjective measures of lighting performance in 39 electrically-lit and daylit galleries from 22 museums throughout the United States. Appropriate univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were used to consolidate the data.
Analysis of this sample revealed that the important stated needs of decision makers and visitors were not met in "reality". The major decision maker mismatch was daylight management as related to artifact preservation in daylit galleries and the major visitor mismatch was artifact appearance in electrically-lit galleries.
Study results suggest the limited resources available should be directed toward minimizing glare, enhancing artifact appearance in terms of color richness and detail visibility, and improving the effectiveness of daylight management to protect artifacts as related to illuminance and relative humidity. Specific improvement strategies are identified.},

Research Design: The expectations of decision maker and visitor stakeholders were determined via a survey of 130 decision makers (museum personnel and designers) and 427 museum visitors. Problems associated with existing conditions were assessed via a comprehensive evaluation using instrument-based lighting measures applied in 39 electrically-lit and daylit galleries (rooms) in 22 U.S. museums. Mismatches between expectations and existing exhibition lighting conditions were summarized. Analysis: Factor analysis was used to consolidate the data. The Friedman test was applied to determine significant differences between mean factor responses. Key Findings: Decision makers and visitors have different expectations. Neither group's priority expectations are met in existing conditions. The major problem among decision makers is daylight management for artifact preservation in daylit galleries. The major problem for visitors is artifact appearance and visibility. Conclusions: Successful design depends on informed decision making, which must be based on documented evidence, not speculation, and should address stakeholders' expectations and field performance problems. Prioritized design recommendations are given.},

	abstract = {Color perception depends profoundly on adaptation processes that adjust sensitivity in response to the prevailing pattern of stimulation. We examined how color sensitivity and appearance might be influenced by adaptation to the color distributions characteristic of natural images. Color distributions were measured for natural scenes by sampling an array of locations within each scene with a spectroradiometer, or by recording each scene with a digital camera successively through 31 interference filters. The images were used to reconstruct the L, M and S cone excitation at each spatial location, and the contrasts along three post-receptoral axes [L + M, L − M or S − (L + M)]. Individual scenes varied substantially in their mean chromaticity and luminance, in the principal color-luminance axes of their distributions, and in the range of contrasts in their distributions. Chromatic contrasts were biased along a relatively narrow range of bluish to yellowish-green angles, lying roughly between the S - (L + M) axis (which was more characteristic of scenes with lush vegetation and little sky) and a unique blue-yellow axis (which was more typical of arid scenes). For many scenes L - M and S - (L + M) signals were highly correlated, with weaker correlations between luminance and chromaticity. We use a two-stage model (von Kries scaling followed by decorrelation) to show how the appearance of colors may be altered by light adaptation to the mean if the distributions and by contrast adaptation to the contrast range and principal axes of the distributions; and we show that such adjustments are qualitatively consistent with empirical measurements of asymmetric color matches obtained after adaptation to successive random samples drawn from natural distributions of chromaticities and lightnesses. Such adaptation effects define the natural range of operating states of the visual system.},

We determined the temporal characteristics of chromatic adaptation for appearance and discrimination along different color directions. Subjects were adapted to a large uniform background made up of a CRT screen and a 45×64° wall, illuminated by computer controlled lamps. After an instant change in background color along a red–green or blue–yellow color axis, we measured thresholds for the detection of increments along the same axes at fixed times between 25 ms and 121 s. Analogously, color appearance was determined using achromatic matching. Three components of adaptation could be identified by their temporal characteristics. A slow exponential time course of adaptation with a half-life of about 20 s was common to appearance and discrimination. A faster component with a half-life of 40–70 ms — probably due to photoreceptor adaptation — was also common to both. Exclusive for color appearance, there was a third, extremely rapid mechanism with a half-life faster than 10 ms. This instantaneous process explained more than 50\% of total adaptation for color appearance and could be shown to act in a multiplicative manner. We conclude that this instantaneous adaptation mechanism for color appearance is situated at a later processing stage, after mechanisms common to appearance and discrimination, and is based on multiplicative spatial interactions rather than on local, temporal adaptational processes. Color appearance, and thus color constancy, seems to be determined in large part by cortical computations.},

For art preservation and energy saving reasons this is not feasible. Museums often use light of 3500 K correlated colour temperature (CCT). A method is described that takes chromatic adaptation into consideration to determine the spectral power distribution producing least colour distortion of object colours while changing from a higher adaptation luminance at 6500 K to 3500 K illumination at a lower adaptation luminance. The method can be used for any CCT and adaptation luminance values.},

	abstract = {Color constancy was studied under conditions simulating either natural or extremely artificial illumination. Four test illuminants were used: two broadband phases of daylight (correlated color temperatures 4000 and 25,000 K) and two spectrally impoverished metamers of these lights, each consisting of only two wavelengths. A computer controlled color monitor was used for reproducing the chromaticities and luminances of an array of Munsell color samples rendered under these illuminants. An asymmetric haploscopic matching paradigm was used in which the same stimulus pattern, either illuminated by one of the test illuminants, or by a standard broadband daylight (D65), was alternately presented to the left and right eye. Subjects adjusted the RGB settings of the samples seen under D65 (match condition), to match the appearance of the color samples seen under the test illuminant. The results show the expected failure of color constancy under two-wavelengths illumination, and approximate color constancy under natural illumination. Quantitative predictions of the results were made on the basis of two different models, a computational model for recovering surface reflectance, and a model that assumes the color response to be determined by cone-specific contrast and absolute level of stimulation (Lucassen and Walraven, 1993). The latter model was found to provide somewhat more accurate predictions, under all illuminant conditions. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Colour can potentially provide useful information for a variety of computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, image retrieval, object recognition and tracking. However, for it to be helpful in practice, colour must relate directly to the intrinsic properties of the imaged objects and be independent of imaging conditions such as scene illumination and the imaging device. To this end many invariant colour representations have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, recent work (Second Workshop on Content-based Multimedia Indexing) has shown that none of them provides good enough practical performance.

In this paper we propose a new colour invariant image representation based on an existing grey-scale image enhancement technique: histogram equalisation. We show that provided the rank ordering of sensor responses are preserved across a change in imaging conditions (lighting or device) a histogram equalisation of each channel of a colour image renders it invariant to these conditions. We set out theoretical conditions under which rank ordering of sensor responses is preserved and we present empirical evidence which demonstrates that rank ordering is maintained in practice for a wide range of illuminants and imaging devices. Finally, we apply the method to an image indexing application and show that the method out performs all previous invariant representations, giving close to perfect illumination invariance and very good performance across a change in device.},

	abstract = {To examine the potential contribution of first-stage photoreceptor adaptation to color constancy, photon catches from 337 natural objects illuminated with phases of daylight and tungsten light were calculated for a model human fovea. The rank ordering of these photon catches within each cone photoreceptor class was examined. When first-stage adaptation is modeled using multiplicative or subtractive mechanisms, or a monotonic nonlinearity, no reordering of the rank ordering of photon catches is possible across illuminant changes. The observed rank orderings remained nearly invariant across illuminant changes for all three photoreceptor classes, although there was some local shifting in the rank orderings, thus ruling out the ability of von Kries adaptation alone to produce perfect color constancy. This means that for objects with natural reflectance spectra, the ordinal relationships between the photon catches within a class of photoreceptors exhibit only minor changes for these illuminant shifts. This result may be attributable to the fact that approx. 95\% of the variance in these reflectance spectra is captured by the first principal component; objects that produce relatively few absorptions under one phase of daylight illumination will also produce relatively few absorptions under another phase. A geometric formalism for understanding these relationships is presented, and limitations on this analysis are discussed.},

This color constancy can be measured operationally by asking observers to distinguish illuminant changes on a scene from changes in the reflecting properties of the surfaces comprising it. It is shown here that during fast illuminant changes, simultaneous changes in spectral reflectance of one or more surfaces in an array of other surfaces can be readily detected almost independent of the numbers of surfaces, suggesting a preattentive, spatially parallel process. This process, which is perfect over a spatial window delimited by the anatomical fovea, may form an early input to a multistage analysis of surface color, providing the visual system with information about a rapidly changing world in advance of the generation of a more elaborate and stable perceptual representation.},

B. 47, 23–58] to learn whether color constancy mechanisms are intact in him, which amounts to learning whether he can assign a constant color to a surface in spite of changes in the precise wavelength composition of the light reflected from that surface. We supplemented our psychophysical studies with imaging ones, using functional magnetic resonance, to learn something about the location of areas that are active in his brain when he perceives colors. The psychophysical results suggested that color constancy mechanisms are severely defective in PB and that his color vision is wavelength-based. The imaging results showed that, when he viewed and recognized colors, significant increases in activity were restricted mainly to V1-V2. We conclude that a partly defective color system operating on its own in a severely damaged brain is able to mediate a conscious experience of color in the virtually total absence of other visual abilities.},

Chromatic aberration spatially separates light of different wavelengths and this allows the spectral power distribution of the light to be extracted. This is more information about the light than is registered by the cones of the human visual system or by a color television camera; and, using it, we show how color constancy, the separation of reflectance from illumination, can be achieved. As examples, we consider grey-level images of (a) a colored dot under unknown illumination, and (b) an edge between two differently colored regions under unknown illumination. Our first result is that in principle we can determine completely the spectral power distribution of the reflected light from the dot or, in the case of the color edge, the difference in the spectral power distributions of the light from the two regions. By employing a finite-dimensional linear model of illumination and surface reflectance, we obtain our second result, which is that the spectrum of the reflected light can be uniquely decomposed into a component due to the illuminant and another component due to the surface reflectance. This decomposition provides the complete spectral reflectance function, and hence color, of the surface as well as the spectral power distribution of the illuminant. Up to the limit of the accuracy of the finite-dimensional model, this effectively solves the color constancy problem.},

Previous perceptual studies have assumed that the brain analyses the colour of a surface independently of its three-dimensional shape and viewing geometry, although there are neural connections between colour and two-dimensional form processing early in the visual pathway. Here we show that colour perception is strongly influenced by three-dimensional shape perception in a novel, chromatic version of the Mach Card—a concave folded card with one side made of magenta paper and the other of white paper. The light reflected from the magenta paper casts a pinkish glow on the white side. The perceived colour of the white side changes from pale pink to deep magenta when the perceived shape of the card flips from concave to convex. The effect demonstrates that the human visual system incorporates knowledge of mutual illumination—the physics of light reflection between surfaces—at an early stage in colour perception.},

In this article we examine how sensor values (e.g., RGB values) are modified in the mutual reflection region and show that a good approximation of the surface spectral reflectance function for each surface can be recovered by using the extra information from mutual reflection. Thus color constancy results from an examination of mutual reflection. Use is made of finite dimensional linear models for ambient illumination and for surface spectral reflectance. If m and n are the number of basis functions required to model illumination and surface spectral reflectance respectively, then we find that the number of different sensor classes p must satisfy the condition p≥(2 n+m)/3. If we use three basis functions to model illumination and three basis functions to model surface spectral reflectance, then only three classes of sensors are required to carry out the algorithm.

	abstract = {Thresholds for detecting changes in color are raised following viewing a field sinusoidally modulated in color over time. This effect is highly selective. For example, thresholds for detecting reddish and greenish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying in a reddishgreenish direction, but not after viewing one varying in a yellowish-bluish direction. Similarly thresholds for yellowish and bluish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying along a yellowish-bluish axis but are not altered by exposure to reddish-greenish variation. Thresholds for chromatic changes are not raised following viewing a field varying in luminance. Thresholds for changes in luminance are raised following viewing a field varying in luminance but not altered by exposure to purely chromatic variation. Since this selectivity is found only for these directions and not intermediate directions in color space we conclude that these directions are cardinal, that is, signals varying along these directions are carried along separate, fatiguable, second stage pathways. The results conform to the expectations of opponent process theory with the important exception that the yellowish-bluish cardinal direction is a tritanopic confusion line and not a red-green equilibrium line.},

The influences of this novel opsin are widespread, ranging from pupillary and circadian responses to brightness perception, yet established approaches to quantifying the biological effects of light do not adequately account for melanopsin sensitivity. We have recently proposed a novel metric, the melanopic sensitivity function (V Z λ), to address this deficiency. Here, we further validate this new measure with a variety of tests based on potential barriers to its applicability identified in the literature or relating to obvious practical benefits. Using electrophysiogical approaches and pupillometry, initially in rodless+coneless mice, our data demonstrate that under a very wide range of different conditions (including switching between stimuli with highly divergent spectral content) the V Z λ function provides an accurate prediction of the sensitivity of melanopsin-dependent responses. We further show that V Z λ provides the best available description of the spectral sensitivity of at least one aspect of the visual response in mice with functional rods and cones: tonic firing activity in the lateral geniculate nuclei. Together, these data establish V Z λ as an important new approach for light measurement with widespread practical utility.},

	abstract = {One of the hallmarks of human cognition is cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt thoughts and behaviors according to changing task demands. Previous research has suggested that the number of different exemplars that must be processed within a task (the set size) can influence an individual's ability to switch flexibly between different tasks. This paper provides evidence that when tasks have a small set size, children's cognitive flexibility is impaired compared to when tasks have a large set size. This paper also offers insights into the mechanism by which this effect comes about. Understanding how set size interacts with task-switching informs the debate regarding the relative contributions of bottom-up priming and top-down control processes in the development of cognitive flexibility. We tested two accounts for the relationship between set size and cognitive flexibility: the (bottom-up) Stimulus-Task Priming account and the (top-down) Rule Representation account. Our findings offered support for the Stimulus-Task Priming account, but not for the Rule Representation account. They suggest that children are susceptible to bottom-up priming caused by stimulus repetition, and that this priming can impair their ability to switch between tasks. These findings make important theoretical and practical contributions to the executive function literature: theoretically, they show that the basic features of a task exert a significant influence on children's ability to flexibly shift between tasks through bottom-up priming effects. Practically, they suggest that children's cognitive flexibility may have been underestimated relative to adults', as paradigms used with children typically have a smaller set size than those used with adults. These findings also have applications in education, where they have the potential to inform teaching in key areas where cognitive flexibility is required, such as mathematics and literacy.},

This pigment is routinely described as “nonvisual” to highlight its signaling role in pupil dilation and circadian rhythms. Here we asked whether light absorbed by melanopsin can be seen by healthy human subjects. To answer this requires delivering intense (above rod saturation), well-controlled lights using four independent primaries. We collected detection thresholds to many four-primary stimuli. Threshold measurements in the fovea are explained by trichromatic theory, with no need to invoke a fourth photopigment. In the periphery, where melanopsin is present, threshold measurements deviate from trichromatic theory; at high photopic levels, sensitivity is explained by absorptions in four, not three, photopigment classes. We consider a series of hypotheses to explain the tetrasensitivity at high photopic levels in the human peripheral field. The most likely hypothesis is that in healthy human subjects melanopsin absorptions influence visibility.},

Normal color observers performed multiple Rayleigh matches (i.e., a series of seven Rayleigh-type color matches using various sets of test and primary lights) in order to derive estimates of the M- and L-photo pigment wavelengths of maximum absorbance. We predicted the ratio of incident radiances Pr/Pg for a range of plausible values in terms of wavelength of the peak sensitivity of the M-cone and L-cone. An algorithm allowed us to adjust the values of the peak wavelength of the cone photo pigments in order to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted and real results of matches. To create candidate M-cone and L-cone photo pigments that best predict the set of equation values, we used the low density spectral absorbance curves of the M-cone and L-cone photo pigments respectively, as tabulated by Stockman and Sharpe (2000), and shifted each template along a logarithmic wavelength scale. For all observers, the system of seven Rayleigh-like equations converges to a unique solution. M- and L-cone photo pigments are estimated separately. The distribution of the wavelength of maximum sensitivity of the photo pigments includes a cluster. Only a few women's results lie outside the cluster. The choice of the template has a considerable influence on the convergence of the algorithm.},

A new physiologically based version of the MacLeod–Boynton chromaticity diagram is proposed by the CIE as well as a cone-fundamental-based (xF, yF) chromaticity diagram.

Amongst the haplorhine (higher) primates, the catarrhines possess uniformly trichromatic colour vision, whereas most of the platyrrhine species exhibit polymorphic colour vision, with a variety of dichromatic and trichromatic phenotypes within the population.
It has been suggested that trichromacy in primates and the reflectance functions of certain tropical fruits are aspects of a coevolved seed–dispersal system: primate colour vision has been shaped by the need to find coloured fruits amongst foliage, and the fruits themselves have evolved to be salient to primates and so secure dissemination of their seeds. We review the evidence for and against this hypothesis and we report an empirical test: we show that the spectral positioning of the cone pigments found in trichromatic South American primates is well matched to the task of detecting fruits against a background of leaves. We further report that particular trichromatic platyrrhine phenotypes may be better suited than others to foraging for particular fruits under particular conditions of illumination; and we discuss possible explanations for the maintenance of polymorphic colour vision amongst the platyrrhines.},

	abstract = {Summary
The illumination of a scene strongly affects our perception of objects in that scene, e.g., the pages of a book illuminated by candlelight will appear quite yellow relative to other types of artificial illuminants. Yet at the same time, the reader still judges the pages as white, their surface color unaffected by the interplay of paper and illuminant. It has been shown empirically [1] that we can indeed report two quite different interpretations of “color”: one is dependent on the constant surface spectral reflectance of an object (surface color) and the other on the power of light of different wavelengths reflected from that object (reflected color). How then are these two representations related? The common view, dating from Aristotle, is that our experience of surface color is derived from reflected color or, in more familiar terms, that color perception follows from color sensation [2–4]. By definition, color constancy requires that vision “discounts the illuminant”; thus, it seems reasonable that vision begins with the color of objects as they naively appear and that we infer from their appearances their surface color. Here, we question this classic view. We use metacontrast-masked priming and, by presenting the unseen prime and the visible mask under different illuminants, dissociate two ways in which the prime matched the mask: in surface color or in reflected color. We find that priming of the mask occurs when it matches the prime in surface color, not reflected color. It follows that color perception can arise without prior color sensation.},

	abstract = {Although many color constancy methods exist, they are all based on specific assumptions such as the set of possible light sources, or the spatial and spectral characteristics of images. As a consequence, no algorithm can be considered as universal. However, with the large variety of available methods, the question is how to select the method that induces equivalent classes for different image characteristics. Furthermore, the subsequent question is how to combine the different algorithms in a proper way. To achieve selection and combining of color constancy algorithms, in this paper, natural image statistics are used to identify the most important characteristics of color images. Then, based on these image characteristics, the proper color constancy algorithm (or best combination of algorithms) is selected for a specific image. To capture the image characteristics, the Weibull parameterization (e.g. texture and contrast) is used. Experiments show that, on a large data set of 11,000 images, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art single algorithms, as well as simple alternatives for combining several algorithms.},

These new data were used to reveal the changes in colour appearance caused by different viewing parameters studied, and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of five uniform colour spaces and colour-appearance models. The results show that Hunt's 91 model (developed to fit earlier experimental results) did not perform as well as it did in the previous studies using nontransmissive media. This implies that there are large differences in perceived colour appearance between transmissive and nontransmissive media viewing conditions. Some modifications were subsequently made to Hunt's 91 model and the predictive accuracy was greatly improved.},

Having obtained the data, they were used to test the accuracy of prediction for various colour spaces and models. The results clearly indicate that Hunt's 91 model gives the best fit to the visual results of all the models studied. Hunt's 91 has been further refined to improve the fit to the colourfulness results, and this refined model has been designated Hunt-ACAM (ACAM being the Alvey Colour Appearance Model). The error of prediction from Hunt-ACAM is close to the typical error that is seen to occur between individuals' results and the mean visual results. This performance is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model is therefore believed to provide a reasonably accurate way of evaluating colour fidelity for various colour reproduction systems. Various chromatic-adaptation transformations were also compared with three sets of corresponding chromaticities derived from the results of experiments conducted under four conditions of chromatic adaptation. The results are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by Helson et al. [Illum. Eng. 47, 221–233 (1952)] and Lam and Rigg [Ph.D. thesis, University of Bradford (1985)]. All results indicate that the Bradford and Hunt-ACAM transformations perform the best and the second best, respectively, of all the selected formulae.

The aim of this project is to develop a colour appearance model capable of predicting changes of colour appearance under various different viewing conditions. This will provide industry with a quantitative measure for assessing the quality of colour reproduction and enable more rapid and accurate proofing simulations in the graphic art industry. A large-scale experiment has been carried out in which colour appearance was assessed under a wide range of viewing conditions. The parameters studied were (1) D65, D50, white fluorescent, and tungsten light sources, (2) luminance levels of about 40 and 240 cd/m2, (3) five background conditions: white, grey, black, grey with white border, and grey with black border, and (4) two media: luminous colours (displayed on a high-resolution colour monitor) and nonluminous colours (presented in a viewing cabinet). Each colour was assessed by a panel of six or seven observers using a magnitude estimation method. In total, 43,332 estimations were made, and these form the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data. Data analysis has been carried out to examine the reliability of the experimental results and to understand the effects of the various viewing parameters studied.

	abstract = {Summary
Using the photopigment melanopsin, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) respond directly to light to drive circadian clock resetting and pupillary constriction. We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information.},

However, a population of atypical photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) expresses the photopigment melanopsin and is intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These ipRGCs are crucial for relaying light information from the retina to the brain to control circadian photoentrainment, pupillary light reflex, and sleep. ipRGCs were initially described as a uniform population involved solely in signaling irradiance for non-image forming functions. Recent work, however, has uncovered that ipRGCs are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular, cellular and functional levels, and could even be involved in image formation. This review summarizes our current understanding of the diversity of ipRGCs and their various roles in modulating behavior.},

Recently a parallel, non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive pathway, arising from a population of retinal ganglion cells, was discovered in nocturnal rodents. These ganglion cells express the putative photopigment melanopsin and by signalling gross changes in light intensity serve the subconscious, 'non-image-forming' functions of circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction. Here we show an anatomically distinct population of 'giant', melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in the primate retina that, in addition to being intrinsically photosensitive, are strongly activated by rods and cones, and display a rare, S-Off, (L + M)-On type of colour-opponent receptive field. The intrinsic, rod and (L + M) cone-derived light responses combine in these giant cells to signal irradiance over the full dynamic range of human vision. In accordance with cone-based colour opponency, the giant cells project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay to primary visual cortex. Thus, in the diurnal trichromatic primate, 'non-image-forming' and conventional 'image-forming' retinal pathways are merged, and the melanopsin-based signal might contribute to conscious visual perception.},

We introduce a rapid and precise method for measuring signs and magnitudes of cone inputs to visual neurons. Colors of stimuli are modulated around circumferences of three color planes in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. For each neuron, the projection of the preferred vector in each plane was estimated by averaging the response phases to clockwise and counterclockwise modulation. The signs and weights of cone inputs were derived directly from the preferred vectors. The efficiency of the method enables us to measure cone inputs at different temporal frequencies and short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cone adaptation levels. The results show that S-cone inputs to the parvocellular and magnocellular ganglion cells are negligible, which implies underlying connectional specificity in the retinal circuitry.},

	abstract = {Colour constancy needs to be reconsidered in light of the limits imposed by metamer mismatching. Metamer mismatching refers to the fact that two objects reflecting metameric light under one illumination may reflect non-metameric light under a second; so two objects appearing as having the same colour under one illuminant can appear as having different colours under a second. Yet since Helmholtz, object colour has generally been believed to remain relatively constant. The deviations from colour constancy registered in experiments are usually thought to be small enough that they do not contradict the notion of colour constancy. However, it is important to determine how the deviations from colour constancy relate to the limits metamer mismatching imposes on constancy. Hence, we calculated metamer mismatching’s effect for the 20 Munsell papers and 8 pairs of illuminants employed in the colour constancy study by Logvinenko and Tokunaga and found it to be so extensive that the two notions—metamer mismatching and colour constancy—must be mutually exclusive. In particular, the notion of colour constancy leads to some paradoxical phenomena such as the possibility of 20 objects having the same colour under chromatic light dispersing into a hue circle of colours under neutral light. Thus, colour constancy refers to a phenomenon, which because of metamer mismatching, simply cannot exist. Moreover, it obscures the really important visual phenomenon; namely, the alteration of object colours induced by illumination change. We show that colour is not an independent, intrinsic attribute of an object, but rather an attribute of an object/light pair, and then define a concept of material colour in terms of equivalence classes of such object/light pairs. We suggest that studying the shift in material colour under a change in illuminant will be more fruitful than pursuing colour constancy’s false premise that colour is an intrinsic attribute of an object.},

	abstract = {Summary
As the ear has dual functions for audition and balance, the eye has a dual role in detecting light for a wide range of behavioral and physiological functions separate from sight [1–11]. These responses are driven primarily by stimulation of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that are most sensitive to short-wavelength (∼480 nm) blue light and remain functional in the absence of rods and cones [8–10]. We examined the spectral sensitivity of non-image-forming responses in two profoundly blind subjects lacking functional rods and cones (one male, 56 yr old; one female, 87 yr old). In the male subject, we found that short-wavelength light preferentially suppressed melatonin, reset the circadian pacemaker, and directly enhanced alertness compared to 555 nm exposure, which is the peak sensitivity of the photopic visual system. In an action spectrum for pupillary constriction, the female subject exhibited a peak spectral sensitivity (λmax) of 480 nm, matching that of the pRGCs but not that of the rods and cones. This subject was also able to correctly report a threshold short-wavelength stimulus (∼480 nm) but not other wavelengths. Collectively these data show that pRGCs contribute to both circadian physiology and rudimentary visual awareness in humans and challenge the assumption that rod- and cone-based photoreception mediate all “visual” responses to light.},

The human retina contains melanopsin, but the literature lacks a direct investigation of its spectral sensitivity or G-protein selectivity. Here, we address this deficit by studying physiological responses driven by human melanopsin under heterologous expression in HEK293 cells. Luminescent reporters for common second messenger systems revealed that light induces a high amplitude increase in intracellular calcium and a modest reduction in cAMP in cells expressing human melanopsin, implying that this pigment is able to drive responses via both Gq and Gi/o class G-proteins. Melanopsins from mouse and amphioxus had a similar profile of G-protein coupling in HEK293 cells, but chicken Opn4m and Opn4x pigments exhibited some Gs activity in addition to a strong Gq/11 response. An action spectrum for the calcium response in cells expressing human melanopsin had the predicted form for an opsin : vitamin A1 pigment and peaked at 479 nm. The G-protein selectivity and spectral sensitivity of human melanopsin is similar to that previously described for rodents, supporting the utility of such laboratory animals for developing methods of manipulating this system using light or pharmacological agents.},

	abstract = {The mammalian eye shows marked adaptations to time of day. Some of these modifications are not acute responses to short-term light exposure but rely upon assessments of the photic environment made over several hours. In the past, all attempts at a mechanistic understanding have assumed that these adaptations originate with light detection by one or other of the classical photoreceptor cells (rods or cones). However, previous work has demonstrated that the mammalian eye contains non-rod, non-cone photoreceptors. This study aimed to determine whether such photoreceptors contribute to retinal adaptation., In the human retina, second-order processing of signals originating in cones takes significantly longer at night than during the day. Long-term light exposure at night is capable of reversing this effect. Here, we employed the cone ERG as a tool to examine the properties of the irradiance measurement pathway driving this reversal. Our findings indicate that this pathway (1) integrates irradiance measures over time periods ranging from at least 15 to 120 min; (2) responds to relatively bright light, having a dynamic range almost entirely outside the sensitivity of rods; (3) acts on the cone pathway primarily through a local retinal mechanism; and (4) detects light via an opsin:vitamin A photopigment (λmax ≅ 483 nm)., A photopigment with a spectral sensitivity profile quite different from those of the classical rod and cone opsins but matching the standard profile of an opsin:vitamin A-based pigment drives adaptations of the human primary cone visual pathway according to time of day.},

The aim of this study was to establish an action spectrum for light-induced melatonin suppression that could help elucidate the ocular photoreceptor system for regulating the human pineal gland. Subjects (37 females, 35 males, mean age of 24.5 ± 0.3 years) were healthy and had normal color vision. Full-field, monochromatic light exposures took place between 2:00 and 3:30 A.M. while subjects' pupils were dilated. Blood samples collected before and after light exposures were quantified for melatonin. Each subject was tested with at least seven different irradiances of one wavelength with a minimum of 1 week between each nighttime exposure. Nighttime melatonin suppression tests (n = 627) were completed with wavelengths from 420 to 600 nm. The data were fit to eight univariant, sigmoidal fluence–response curves (R 2 = 0.81–0.95). The action spectrum constructed from these data fit an opsin template (R 2 = 0.91), which identifies 446–477 nm as the most potent wavelength region providing circadian input for regulating melatonin secretion. The results suggest that, in humans, a single photopigment may be primarily responsible for melatonin suppression, and its peak absorbance appears to be distinct from that of rod and cone cell photopigments for vision. The data also suggest that this new photopigment is retinaldehyde based. These findings suggest that there is a novel opsin photopigment in the human eye that mediates circadian photoreception.},

Further, a dose of 4.19 × 1013 photon/cm2/sec at 505 nm was significantly stronger (P {\textless} 0.01) than an equal photon dose at 555 nm for melatonin suppression.

Their action spectrum ( max 480 nm) implicates an opsin and melanopsin is the only opsin known to exist in these cells. Melanopsin is required for ipRGC photosensitivity and for behavioural photoresponses that survive disrupted rod and cone function. Heterologously expressed melanopsin apparently binds retinaldehyde and mediates photic activation of G proteins. However, its amino-acid sequence differs from vertebrate photosensory opsins and some have suggested that melanopsin may be a photoisomerase, providing retinoid chromophore to an unidentified opsin. To determine whether melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, here we transiently expressed it in HEK293 cells that stably expressed TRPC3 channels. Light triggered a membrane depolarization in these cells and increased intracellular calcium. The light response resembled that of ipRGCs, with almost identical spectral sensitivity ( max 479 nm). The phototransduction pathway included Gq or a related G protein, phospholipase C and TRPC3 channels. We conclude that mammalian melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, that it is the photopigment of ganglion-cell photoreceptors, and that these photoreceptors may use an invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade.},

	abstract = {In mammals, a small number of retinal ganglion cells express melanopsin, an opsin photopigment, allowing them to be directly photoreceptive. A major function of these so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is to synchronize (entrain) endogenous circadian clocks to the external light:dark cycle. Thanks to their intrinsic light response, ipRGCs can support photoentrainment even when the other retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are absent or inactive. However, in the intact retina the ipRGC light response is a composite of extrinsic (rod/cone) and intrinsic (melanopsin) influences. As a result all three photoreceptor classes contribute to the retinal pathways providing light information to the clock. Here, we consider what each photoreceptor type contributes to the clock light response. We review electrophysiological and behavioral data pertinent to this question, primarily from laboratory rodents, drawing them together to provide a conceptual model in which each photoreceptor class plays a distinct role in encoding the light environment. We finally use this model to highlight some of the important outstanding questions in this field.},

	abstract = {A direct projection from melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) reaches the primary visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; dLGN). The significance of this melanopsin input to the visual system is only recently being investigated. One unresolved question is the degree to which neurons in the dLGN could use melanopsin to track dynamic changes in light intensity under light adapted conditions. Here we set out to address this question. We were able to present full field steps visible only to melanopsin by switching between rod-isoluminant ‘yellow’ and ‘blue’ lights in a mouse lacking cone function (Cnga3 -/- ). In the retina these stimuli elicited melanopsin-like responses from a subset of ganglion cells. When presented to anaesthetised mice, we found that {\textasciitilde}25-30\% of visually responsive neurones in the contralateral dLGN responded to these melanopsin-isolating steps with small increases in firing rate. Such responses could be elicited even with fairly modest increases in effective irradiance (32\% Michelson contrast for melanopsin). These melanopsin-driven responses were apparent at bright backgrounds (corresponding to twilight-daylight conditions), but their threshold irradiance was strongly dependent upon prior light exposure when stimuli were superimposed on a spectrally neutral ramping background light. While both onset and offset latencies were long for melanopsin-derived responses compared to those evoked by rods, there was great variability in these parameters with some cells responding to melanopsin steps in \&lt;1 s. These data indicate that a subset of dLGN units can employ melanopsin signals to detect modest changes in irradiance under photopic conditions.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are depolarized by light by two mechanisms: directly, through activation of their photopigment melanopsin; and indirectly through synaptic circuits driven by rods and cones. To learn more about the rod and cone circuits driving ipRGCs, we made multielectrode array (MEA) and patch-clamp recordings in wildtype and genetically modified mice. Rod-driven ON inputs to ipRGCs proved to be as sensitive as any reaching the conventional ganglion cells. These signals presumably pass in part through the primary rod pathway, involving rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells coupled to ON cone bipolar cells through gap junctions. Consistent with this interpretation, the sensitive rod ON input to ipRGCs was eliminated by pharmacological or genetic disruption of gap junctions, as previously reported for conventional ganglion cells. A presumptive cone input was also detectable as a brisk, synaptically mediated ON response that persisted after disruption of rod ON pathways. This was roughly three log units less sensitive than the rod input. Spectral analysis revealed that both types of cones, the M- and S-cones, contribute to this response and that both cone types drive ON responses. This contrasts with the blue-OFF, yellow-ON chromatic opponency reported in primate ipRGCs. The cone-mediated response was surprisingly persistent during steady illumination, echoing the tonic nature of both the rod input to ipRGCs and their intrinsic, melanopsin-based phototransduction. These synaptic inputs greatly expand the dynamic range and spectral bandpass of the non-image-forming visual functions for which ipRGCs provide the principal retinal input.},

An action spectrum for the PLR in rd/rd cl mice demonstrates that over the range 420−625 nm, this response is driven by a single opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment with peak sensitivity around 479 nm (opsin photopigment/OP479).

The former is related to chromatic adaptation theory and the latter to performance on field trial data. In addition, CAT-Type III is necessary for a specific and practical purposes. The need for classifying to CAT-Type I and CAT-Type II is found from a careful inspection of the development process from Nayatani et al. transform to BFD transform, referring to the Ph. D. thesis by Lam (University of Bradford, 1985). The process clearly shows two types of flows on the development of various CATs. One is the flow for deepening the theory of chromatic adaptation (CAT-Type I), and the other is for giving good performance to existing field trial data and also ease of use (CAT-Type II). Additional CAT-Type III is, for example, CAT recommended in CIE TC 8-04 technical report. The CAT is only applicable to compare hardcopy and softcopy images for the specified observing conditions in the report. Still, a difficult problem, determination of corresponding colors, remains in the method of subjective estimation, which is useful and widely used for estimating chromatic adaptation effects experimentally. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To address this question, a colour-naming experiment was performed with colour-monitor images of natural scenes simulated under two different daylights of correlated colour temperature 6500 K and 25000 K. Images were obtained from a set of hyperspectral data to enable the accurate control of illuminant and reflectance spectra. Each scene contained a spherical test surface whose digitally manipulated spectral reflectance coincided with that of a sample drawn randomly from approximately 430 Munsell reflectances grouped into eight colour categories, namely, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, purple, brown, and orange. Observers had to name the colour of the test surface in each image, presented for 1 s, by pressing one of nine computer keys corresponding to the eight categorical colour names and a neutral category. Focal colours were estimated from the peaks of the smoothed distributions of observers' naming responses in the CIE 1976 (u′, v′) chromaticity diagram. The effect of the illuminant change was quantified by a focal colour constancy index, with values 0 and 1 corresponding to no constancy and perfect constancy. Average levels of focal colour constancy were close to those from traditional measures of colour constancy, but with variation across categories and surface lightness. For blue and purple surfaces levels approached 0.9. For many surface colours, colour naming seems to be robust under illuminant changes and may help to anchor non-categorical judgements of arbitrary surface colours in natural scenes.},

However, the success in the automation of this process relies on having an appropriate psychophysical data set for this purpose. In this article we present a data set obtained from a colour-naming experiment. In this experiment, we used a scoring method to collect a set of judgments adequate for the fuzzy modeling of the colour-naming task. The data set is composed of 387 colour reflectances, their CIELab and Munsell values, and the corresponding judgments provided by the subjects in the experiment. These judgments are the membership values to the 11 basic colour categories proposed by Berlin and Kay (Berlin B, Kay P. Berkeley: University of California; 1969). All these data have been made available online (http://www.cvc.uab.es/color\_naming) and, in this article we provide a wide analysis of them. To prove the suitability of the proposed scoring methodology, we have computed a set of common statistics in colour-naming experiments, such as consensus and consistency, on our data set. The results make it possible for us to conclude the coherence of our data with previous experiments and, thus, its usefulness for the fuzzy modeling of colour naming. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The “silent substitution” method, which has become well-known mostly through the work of Rushton and his collaborators, can be traced back to experiments performed by M. Ishihara under Exner's supervision at the beginning of the century. Rushton provided a theoretical framework for the method with the enunciation of his “principle of univariance”, In this paper we show how the “silent substitution” concept can be further generalized to any arbitrary number of photoreceptor classes by making use of well-established concepts of colorimetry. With this approach, which we have called “spectral compensation”, one also gains a better insight into the possibilities and shortcomings of the technique. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to examine a number of published studies where use has been made of “silent substitution”, with particular emphasis on the work of W.A.H. Rushton.},

	abstract = {In the mammalian retina, besides the conventional rod–cone system, a melanopsin-associated photoreceptive system exists that conveys photic information for accessory visual functions such as pupillary light reflex and circadian photo-entrainment. On ablation of the melanopsin gene, retinal ganglion cells that normally express melanopsin are no longer intrinsically photosensitive. Furthermore, pupil reflex, light-induced phase delays of the circadian clock and period lengthening of the circadian rhythm in constant light are all partially impaired. Here, we investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate in these responses. Using mice lacking rods and cones, we measured the action spectrum for phase-shifting the circadian rhythm of locomotor behaviour. This spectrum matches that for the pupillary light reflex in mice of the same genotype, and that for the intrinsic photosensitivity of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. We have also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled with disabled rod and cone phototransduction mechanisms. These animals have an intact retina but fail to show any significant pupil reflex, to entrain to light/dark cycles, and to show any masking response to light. Thus, the rod–cone and melanopsin systems together seem to provide all of the photic input for these accessory visual functions.},

The excitation level of the short-wavelength (S) cones was varied in the experiments, although for any given measurement the S-cone excitation was common to the two target fields and could not be directly used for discrimination. Adaptation was maintained by a steady neutral background metameric to Illuminant D65. Thresholds varied substantially and systematically with the S-cone level of the target probes, but in a complex way: when the ratio of L:M cone excitation was low, an increase in S-cone excitation reduced the thresholds, but when the L:M ratio was higher, an increase in S-cone excitation raised the thresholds. To account for the pattern of results, we postulate a neural channel that draws synergistic inputs from L and S cones and an opposed input from M cones. The proposed channel has a compressive response function and is most sensitive at the point set by the steady background.},

He used this insight to explain color contrast effects and the Paradox of Monge (the desaturation of red objects seen through a red filter). He proposed that we can estimate the chromaticity of the illuminant in any scene because all surfaces reflect to us varying mixtures of (i) the body color and (ii) a specular component that represents the illuminant. He also realized that white objects have a special property: Provided that they are illuminated by a single illuminant, such objects exhibit no variation in chromaticity across their surface. Thus at least one of the unique hues exists as an external reference on which observers can agree. It is suggested that other unique hues may also have a basis in the external world.},

This investigation measured the loci of achromatic points for various intensities of a test field presented in a real rather than a simulated environment, lit by illuminants of various chromaticities. The achromatic point varied markedly with the intensity level of the test field: for dim test fields it was close to the surround chromaticity, but for high luminance test fields it was almost invariant with the surround chromaticity. The varying achromatic settings imply a variation in the relative effectiveness of the different cone types, but this variation originates in the postreceptoral system rather than at the photoreceptors themselves: flicker photometric sensitivity was almost independent of the illuminant in all cases. Nor does the variation take the simple form of a sensitivity-scaling coefficient; such a model can not predict the observed dependence of the achromatic setting on test intensity. The data could, however, be modeled with a scheme in which the log of the relative cone weight implicit in the achromatic setting depends almost linearly on (1) the log of the relative cone excitation by the illuminant and (2) the log of the test field intensity.},

The system is validated against an integrating sphere spectrometer using 22 pigments. Measurements were made on several Old Master drawings and one nineteenth-century watercolour. Results are reported for a watercolour by Eugene Louis Lami to illustrate application of the system. For a square object, 23970 individual reflection spectra are captured in a single scan resulting in file sizes of typically 115 MB. Software has been created that permits direct access, by on-screen selection, to the reflection spectrum of any given pixel in an image, reconstructed from the reflection data. PGP-type spectral scanning systems offer the advantage of potentially very high spectral resolutions of {\textless}0.5 nm, though the implementation here is for 5 nm resolution. Digital resolution across a square object is 512 × ∼50 for a PGP slit width of 80 μm. Details of the basic device construction, calibration and operation are provided. The system described here was designed for relatively low spatial resolution, although higher resolution can be achieved with modifications suggested in this publication.},

After a light dosage of approximately 17.5 Mlux-hours under controlled temperature and humidity conditions, 113 of 125 samples (90\% of the sample set) were shown to exhibit less color change in a low-oxygen environment compared with its behavior in air. Thirty-nine percent of this subset displayed color change in anoxia that was between two and four times lower than that observed in air, whereas 47\% showed color change in anoxia reduced by a factor of four or more. In contrast, six samples exhibited greater color change in anoxia than in air – these samples included Prussian blue watercolor (three samples), Antwerp blue watercolor, Verdigris dry pigment, and Fluorescent Yellow Winsor \& Newton Gouache. Although the results from this small sample subset may cause concern when considering the use of anoxia in the conservation of cultural heritage, particularly for colorant systems whose behavior in anoxia has not yet been identified, this study demonstrates the overwhelming benefits of anoxic light exposure for the vast majority of samples investigated here.},

	abstract = {Virtual Reality has great potential to become a usable design tool for the planning of light and colour in buildings. The technical development has provided us with better computer graphics and faster rendering techniques. However, the reliability and usability is delimited by lack of knowledge about how humans perceive spatial colour phenomena. The setting up of parameters for material properties in light calculation software is done arbitrarily. We present a comparison between a real room and a digital model evaluated on a desktop PC and in an Immersive Projection Technology (IPT) type system. Data were collected from video recorded interviews and questionnaires. The participants assessed the appearance of light, colours and space. They also evaluated their involvement in solving this task, and their presence in each environment. Our results highlight the benefits and disadvantages of the real and virtual models. The participants had difficulties in estimating the size of both the desktop room and the room in the ITP system. The comparison of real and virtual rooms revealed unsatisfying differences in shadowing and colour appearance. We defined the magnitude of perceived colour reflections in the real room, and elaborated with some of the parameters in Lightscape/3dsmax6.},

	abstract = {Nocturnal white light exposure has shown marked results on subjective and objective indicators of alertness, vitality and mood, yet effects of white light during daytime and under usual office work conditions have not been investigated extensively. The current study employed a mixed-group design (N = 32), testing effects of two illuminance levels (200 lx or 1000 lx at eye level, 4000 K) during one hour of morning versus afternoon exposure. In four repeated blocks, subjective reports, objective performance and physiological arousal were measured. Results showed effects of illuminance on subjective alertness and vitality, sustained attention in tasks, and heart rate and heart rate variability. Participants felt less sleepy and more energetic in the high versus the low lighting condition, had shorter reaction times on the psychomotor vigilance task and increased physiological arousal. Effects of illuminance on the subjective measures, as well as those on heart rate were not dependent on time of day or duration of exposure. Performance effects were most pronounced in the morning sessions and towards the end of the one-hour exposure period. The effect on heart rate variability was also most pronounced at the end of the one-hour exposure. The results demonstrate that even under normal, i.e., neither sleep nor light deprived conditions, more intense light can improve feelings of alertness and vitality, as well as objective performance and physiological arousal.},

Results showed that participants felt less sleepy, more vital and happier when exposed to bright light. Effects on subjective sleepiness and self-control capacity were stronger under mental fatigue. Vigilance benefited from bright light exposure – although this effect emerged with a delay irrespective of the antecedent condition.

Non-image forming, irradiance-dependent responses mediated by the human eye include synchronisation of the circadian axis and suppression of pineal melatonin production. The retinal photopigment(s) transducing these light responses in humans have not been characterised.


*
2
Using the ability of light to suppress nocturnal melatonin production, we aimed to investigate its spectral sensitivity and produce an action spectrum. Melatonin suppression was quantified in 22 volunteers in 215 light exposure trials using monochromatic light (30 min pulse administered at circadian time (CT) 16-18) of different wavelengths (λmax 424, 456, 472, 496, 520 and 548 nm) and irradiances (0.7-65.0 μW cm−2).


*
3
At each wavelength, suppression of plasma melatonin increased with increasing irradiance. Irradiance-response curves (IRCs) were fitted and the generated half-maximal responses (IR50) were corrected for lens filtering and used to construct an action spectrum.


*
4
The resulting action spectrum showed unique short-wavelength sensitivity very different from the classical scotopic and photopic visual systems. The lack of fit (r2 {\textless} 0.1) of our action spectrum with the published rod and cone absorption spectra precluded these photoreceptors from having a major role. Cryptochromes 1 and 2 also had a poor fit to the data. Fitting a series of Dartnall nomograms generated for rhodopsin-based photopigments over the λmax range 420-480 nm showed that rhodopsin templates between λmax 457 and 462 nm fitted the data well (r2≥ 0.73). Of these, the best fit was to the rhodopsin template with λmax 459 nm (r2= 0.74).


*

Our data strongly support a primary role for a novel short-wavelength photopigment in light-induced melatonin suppression and provide the first direct evidence of a non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive system in humans.},

Spectral opponency is fundamental to the model, providing a parsimonious explanation of some recently published data.

	abstract = {An experiment was performed to: 1) Test the hypothesis that the ratio P*(S/P)0.5 can be used to predict the perception of spatial brightness, and 2) directly compare the rapid-sequential and side-by-side evaluation modes for assessing spatial brightness. The two evaluation modes produced comparable results. Though the side-by-side method has in the past been questioned by others, the data herein illustrates that it is neither faulty nor invalid. Red, green, and blue LEDs were employed to create four light settings that were permutations of two S/P ratios (1.7 and 2.6) and two luminance levels (24 and 30 cd/m2). The S/P ratios corresponded to the practical extremities of CCT (2900 and 7200 K) and were structured to have their chromaticity on the blackbody locus. At equal luminance there was no difference in the perception of brightness, irrespective of CCT. At unequal luminance, but when the ratio of P*(S/P)0.5 was set to 1:1, brightness perception was predicted by luminance. These data suggest that spatial brightness perceptions at photopic light levels are unrelated to the S/P ratio of the illumination. These results are consistent with the “prime color” theory of vision that is rooted in the trichromatic nature of human vision.},

This paper concerns the last factor and presents two radiometric and one colorimetric methods of predicting cool–warm balanced illuminants. For a high correlated colour temperature, the spectral power distributions of Planckian and daylight-simulating illuminants are high in short wavelengths and low in long wavelengths and, therefore, appear bluish. The reverse is true for low correlated colour temperature illuminants, which appear yellowish. The balanced spectral power distribution occurs at 5000 K. MacAdam’s complementary powers function is psychophysical and represents the power of wavelengths across the visible spectrum required to neutralize (convert to white) their complementaries. Again the balanced power occurs for illuminants of 5000 K. Hence, a correlated colour temperature in the 4500–5500 K range is recommended for cool–warm balanced illuminants. This recommendation is supported by results of four recent experimental studies.},

This paper presents a psychophysical experiment in which 70 observers evaluated the colour quality of natural objects under different spectral power distributions with different values of FCI but the same correlated colour temperature (3000 and 5000 K). Results show that FCI holds a nearly perfect linear correlation with vividness (r = 0.976); unnaturalness associated with enhanced vividness rendered by excessively high FCI deteriorates preference. These effects are independent of correlated colour temperatures, but are dependent upon the visual targets used because of limitations in the derivation of FCI. Compared to other metrics, FCI can characterise vividness under a light source.},

Stable inferences about surface color might be supported by spatial ratios of cone excitations from the reflected light, but their invariance has been quantified only for global changes in illuminant spectrum. The aim here was to test their invariance under natural changes in both illumination spectrum and geometry, especially in the distribution of shadows. Time-lapse hyperspectral radiance images were acquired from five outdoor vegetated and nonvegetated scenes. From each scene, 10,000 pairs of points were sampled randomly and ratios measured across time. Mean relative deviations in ratios were generally large, but when sampling was limited to short distances or moderate time intervals, they fell below the level for detecting violations in ratio invariance. When illumination changes with uneven geometry were excluded, they fell further, to levels obtained with global changes in illuminant spectrum alone. Within sampling constraints, ratios of cone excitations, and also of opponent-color combinations, provide an approximately invariant signal for stable surface-color inferences, despite spectral and geometric variations in scene illumination.},

Unlike the changes in time and their consequences for color appearance and constancy, the spatial variations of local illumination color in natural scenes have received relatively little attention. The aim of the present work was to characterize these spatial variations by spectral imaging. Hyperspectral radiance images were obtained from 30 rural and urban scenes in which neutral probe spheres were embedded. The spectra of the local illumination at 17 sample points on each sphere in each scene were extracted and a total of 1904 chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperatures (CCTs) derived. Maximum differences in chromaticities over spheres and over scenes were similar. When data were pooled over scenes, CCTs ranged from 3000 K to 20,000 K, a variation of the same order of magnitude as that occurring over the day. Any mechanisms that underlie stable surface color perception in natural scenes need to accommodate these large spatial variations in local illumination color.},

These have resulted in restrictions on the use of daylight and prolonged development of systems to deliver and control its admittance. Attempts to control daylight and deliver fixed illuminance levels have proved difficult to sustain. Recent installations, in the 1980s and 1990s, have become reliant on a proportion of electric lighting during most opening hours and an acceptance of limited daylight variability within dosage recommendations. Given the difficulties in estimating and measuring dosage, most museums have limited data on their actual lighting performance, and guidance is sparse on how such targets can be met. This paper reviews the limited goals widely referred to in guidance to designers and presents typical data drawn from monitoring in the Frick Collection, New York. The balance between electric light and daylight is discussed in the context of an interior's daylit sensibility, and this provides the basis for a proposed widening of criteria for lighting performance in museum galleries.},

We have carried out the spectral and colorimetric characterization of some paintings located in the Murcielagos (bats) cave (Zuheros, CÃÂ³rdoba, Spain). From this characterization, the chromatic changes produced under different lighting conditions are analysed. The damage function is also computed for the different illuminants used. From the results obtained, it is proposed an illuminant whose spectral distribution diminishes the damage by minimizing the absorption of radiation and optimises the color perception of the paintings in this cave. The procedure followed in this study can be applied to optimise the lighting systems used when illuminating any other art work},

	abstract = {Display lighting which enhances object appearance may be legitimate for many museum exhibits, but is generally inappropriate for works of art. These require presentation which reveals their intrinsic visible characteristics with accuracy and honesty, and the term 'exhibition' is used to distinguish this process from display. It requires that the entire setting, including lighting, develops from an aim to reveal works of art rather than to enhance them, and the notion of 'the well-lit room' is promoted as a concept which expresses the essentials of this design approach. However, it is evident that these may conflict with recommended illuminance maxima, particularly the 50 lux level for more sensitive objects. A working model of the photochemical processes is proposed to give an improved basis for specifying control of lighting. Limiting values of annual damage exposure are derived from the current illuminance maxima recommendations; these permit a more flexible approach to reconciling competing requirements for exhibition and conservation. Also, the model provides a framework which enables information relating to exposure of materials and to means for controlling degradation to be evaluated in terms which can readily be related to actual conditions of exhibition m museums and art galleries.},

Here, we investigate perceptual responses under illumination from two sources, a blue-pumped LED with a colour rendering index of 85 (BLED85), and a violet-pumped LED with a colour rendering index of 97 (VLED97). Forty-eight participants completed three experiments. Neutral, red, and pink were preferred under VLED97. Skin rendition was preferred by Caucasians under VLED97; Asians had no preference. Teeth and a white shirt were whiter and more preferred under VLED97. We conclude that the colour and whiteness rendition must be considered on a par with luminous efficacy.},

Twenty-four observers of different gender and educational background participated to evaluate oil and gouache paintings under different lighting conditions.

	abstract = {Objective
To weight the rod-, cone-, and melanopsin-mediated activation of the retinal ganglion cells, which drive the pupil light reflex by varying the light stimulus wavelength, intensity, and duration.
Design
Experimental study.
Participants
Forty-three subjects with normal eyes and 3 patients with neuroretinal visual loss.
Methods
A novel stimulus paradigm was developed using either a long wavelength (red) or short wavelength (blue) light given as a continuous Ganzfeld stimulus with stepwise increases over a 2 log-unit range. The pupillary movement before, during, and after the light stimulus was recorded in real time with an infrared illuminated video camera.
Main Outcome Measures
The percent pupil contraction of the transient and sustained pupil response to a low- (1 cd/m2), medium- (10 cd/m2), and high-intensity (100 cd/m2) red- and blue-light stimulus was calculated for 1 eye of each subject. From the 43 normal eyes, median and 25th, 75th, 5th, and 95th percentile values were obtained for each stimulus condition.
Results
In normal eyes at lower intensities, blue light evoked much greater pupil responses compared with red light when matched for photopic luminance. The transient pupil contraction was generally greater than the sustained contraction, and this disparity was greatest at the lowest light intensity and least apparent with bright (100 cd/m2) blue light. A patient with primarily rod dysfunction (nonrecordable scotopic electroretinogram) showed significantly reduced pupil responses to blue light at lower intensities. A patient with achromatopsia and an almost normal visual field showed selective reduction of the pupil response to red-light stimulation. A patient with ganglion cell dysfunction owing to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy demonstrated global loss of pupil responses to red and blue light in the affected eye.
Conclusions
Pupil responses that differ as a function of light intensity and wavelength support the hypothesis that selected stimulus conditions can produce pupil responses that reflect phototransduction primarily mediated by rods, cones, or melanopsin. Use of chromatic pupil responses may be a novel way to diagnose and monitor diseases affecting either the outer or inner retina.

To determine the brightness perception of colored objects, luminance calculations and measurements were conducted. The areas of the “color brightness graph” in this study correspond to the results of eight different color sample papers under each of the LED lights with different CCTs. The luminance values were calculated by multiplying the SPD by the spectral luminous efficiency and spectral reflectance of a colored object. The luminance values were measured under these conditions to identify the relationship between the luminance calculations and the measured values. Efficient CCTs were identified for each color sample in terms of the brightness of the colored object. Further subjective evaluations were also conducted to identify the relationship between luminance values and subjective brightness perception. In addition, subjective evaluations of the color appearance perception were conducted to identify the overall visibility concept of colored objects. The subjective evaluations included brightness perception, color appearance, and similarity of the reference light source. The visibility of the colored objects was analyzed according to the results of the brightness and appearance perception of the colored objects that were illuminated by LED lights with various CCTs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The project explores by experiment in a full-scale mock-up gallery the lighting requirements in terms of three variables: painting illuminance, light source and light distribution within the gallery space. Subjective assessments were made using semantic differential scales and the results were analysed using factor analysis techniques. The findings indicate that a painting illuminance approaching 200 lux was required to give visual satisfaction from an illuminant with a high Colour Rendering Index and a high gamut area: also a degree of non-uniformity in light distribution was preferred. The work recommends that where strict conservation requirements are to be employed, then artificial lighting only should be used but that the galleries should be combined with other spaces lit with natural light, perhaps for the display of non-light-sensitive exhibits.},

The main aim of the TC is to recommend a colour-difference formula for complex image together with suitable perceptibility thresholds for industrial applications. With this in mind, a set of experimental results for assessing perceptibility thresholds were accumulated using printed images. The results from different data sets were found to be quite consistent. This set of images are currently being circulated and assessed at different imaging companies.},

Part 1 of results were used to test various colour-difference formulae and to develop a simple formula based on CIELAB but adaptive to each image. The formula was further verified using Part 2 data. The results showed that the formula works well for not only threshold but also supra-threshold colour differences.},

Using 13 images, 182 test images were generated to have various average lightness, chroma or hue values compared to the original images. Twenty observers estimated the overall color difference between the reference and manipulated images shown on an sRGB monitor with 250 cd/m2 as a peak white in a dark room. The magnitude estimation technique was adopted for the visual assessment. The parametric factors of CMC(l:c), and CIEDE2000(l:c) were optimized using the color difference data set. Results showed that CIEDE2000 performs better than CMC. The best ratio for CMC(l:c) is (4:3), while (3.5:1) is the best for CIEDE2000(l:c) for overall color difference prediction.},

	abstract = {The CIE general colour rendering index (Ra) is still the only widely used and accepted colour fidelity index for characterising white light sources. However, user preference for light sources is not determined by fidelity alone but also by colour saturation. Here, we investigate the impact of fidelity and gamut area on the preference for white light sources in three application areas: fresh food, packaged food and skin tones. Thirty-four participants evaluated the attractiveness of object appearance for seven light sources with Ra values ranging between 70 and 100 and relative gamut area index (Ga) ranging between 90 and 120. Results show that object appearance was rated as more attractive for light sources with a larger colour gamut, which have Ra values of 80 and lower. In general, light sources with relatively high spectral power in the long wavelength range, enhancing red objects, received the highest preference. We conclude that, next to fidelity, colour saturation makes a significant contribution to the appreciation of a light source. We therefore propose using Ra in conjunction with Ga and a colour rendering graphic for providing a more detailed description of the colour quality of white LED light sources.},

analysis in a variety of museums. This research component is
significant to understand the complexity and various facets of
overall museum lighting design. This study evaluates both the
quantitative and qualitative aspects of lighting design in four

are observed in these museums’ environments to analyze lighting

The spectral characteristics of the light source used during the image acquisition extremely influence the quality of the final digital reproduction of color films; this paper thoroughly discusses the criteria to be adopted to properly choose the light source. A method is described to infer the analytical densities of a color film from a set of measurements of the integral density; this provides the necessary spectroscopic information for the choice of the light source. The experimental part reports the analysis of two photographic samples from archival material: a Technicolor and an Agfacolor from the 1940s. The experiments highlighted the peculiar spectroscopic characteristics of the analyzed samples. The attention was drawn on the historical aesthetics of color film and the ethical issues related to its preservation.},

	abstract = {Our visual system can easily estimate the constant color and material of external objects despite dynamic changes in the retinal image across viewpoints and illuminations in natural scenes. It is commonly believed that this high-level visual function, called "perceptual constancy," is acquired through postnatal learning [1], building upon low-level functions that have developed earlier, such as image discrimination. However, we demonstrate here that before developing perceptual constancy, 3- to 4-month-old infants have a striking ability to discriminate slight image changes due to illumination that are not salient for adults. These young infants lose this ability after 5 months of age and then develop an ability to perceive distal surface properties (glossy or matte) at 7-8 months of age. Moreover, we identify the transition period between these two functions at 5-6 months of age, wherein infants show difficulty in both image and surface discrimination. These findings support the notion that acquiring perceptual constancy leads to a loss of sensitivity to variant information, which is negligible for constant surface material perception. We suggest that the immature visual system may initially directly access local image features and then develops a complementary constant neural representation of the properties of an object.},

Metamerism can be avoided by selecting modern substitutes with similar spectral reflectance curves to the traditional pigments. It is shown that manganese blue is the most suitable modern pigment for matching azurite and French ultramarine for matching genuine ultramarine, and that it is inadvisable to try matching Prussian blue with French ultramarine, cobalt blue or cerulean blue. Pigments are also recommended for matching smalt and indigo provided these pigments have not undergone a degenerative colour change.},

	shorttitle = {Museum {Skepticism}},
	abstract = {In Museum Skepticism, art historian David Carrier traces the birth, evolution, and decline of the public art museum as an institution meant to spark democratic debate and discussion. Carrier contends that since the inception of the public art museum during the French Revolution, its development has depended on growth: on the expansion of collections, particularly to include works representing non-European cultures, and on the proliferation of art museums around the globe. Arguing that this expansionist project has peaked, he asserts that art museums must now find new ways of making high art relevant to contemporary lives. Ideas and inspiration may be found, he suggests, in mass entertainment such as popular music and movies.Carrier illuminates the public role of art museums by describing the ways they influence how art is seen: through their architecture, their collections, the narratives they offer museum visitors. He insists that an understanding of the art museum must take into account the roles of collectors, curators, and museum architects. Toward that end, he offers a series of case studies, showing how particular museums and their collections evolved. Among those who figure prominently are Baron Dominique Vivant Denon, the first director of the Louvre; Bernard Berenson, whose connoisseurship helped Isabella Stewart Gardner found her museum in Boston; Ernest Fenollosa, who assembled much of the Asian art collection now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Albert Barnes, the distinguished collector of modernist painting; and Richard Meier, architect of the J. Paul Getty Center in Los Angeles. Carrier’s learned consideration of what the art museum is and has been provides the basis for understanding the radical transformation of its public role now under way.},

	abstract = {Many types of museum exhibits are susceptible to damage caused by exposure to light, and current recommendations for museum lighting include avoidance of nonvisible radiant power (UV and IR), limitation of illumination level, and restriction of exposure duration. However, these recommendations do not distinguish between the potential of incident radiant power in the visible spectrum to stimulate the sense of brightness (illuminance) and its potential to cause damage (irradiance).This article investigates the notion that the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent sources could be matched with significantly less irradiance by illumination composed of three spectral bands corresponding to red, green, and blue light. Pairs of identical artworks were displayed in two adjacent simulated art galleries, and 16 subjects adjusted the illumination in the test gallery to match the appearance of the similar display in the comparison gallery. The light source in the comparison gallery was an MR tungsten halogen display spotlight of either low (2850 K) or intermediate (4200 K) color temperature. The light source in the test gallery was either an identical MR spotlight, or it was an experimental three-band source of far lesser irradiance for which the color temperature had been matched to that in the comparison gallery.It was found that, when instructed to adjust for equality of appearance, the subjects set for equality of illuminance. For this condition, the irradiance of the artworks was significantly less for the three-band source than for either of the MR lamps. Also, at equal illuminance and color temperatures, subjects' responses indicated that they were conscious of differences in appearance between the three-band source and the MR lamps, but the difference seemed slight and they did not necessarily discriminate against the three-band source. It is concluded that a practical light source for museums could be developed that would have the potential to equal the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent lamps at a given illuminance, while exposing exhibits to significantly less irradiance, thus reducing their rate of degradation while on display.},

Subjects exhibited sterotypical behaviour on the performance measures; their scaling responses were quite idiosyncratic, although some subjective responses to the experimental parameters varied like the performance responses.

	abstract = {In the late 1960s, Berlin and Kay argued that there are commonalities of basic colour term use that extend across languages and cultures, and probably express universal features of perception and cognition. In 1992, at the Asilomar Conference Centre, visual scientists and psychologists met with linguists and anthropologists for the first time to examine how these claims have fared in the light of current knowledge. To what extent can cross-cultural regularities be explained by the operation of the human visual system? What can the study of colour categorisation tell us about concept formation? Are the Berlin-Kay results an artifact of their methods? What tools have been and should be used to probe the structure of human colour categories? In this volume, which arose from that conference but also incorporates new work, a distinguished team of contributors survey key ideas, results and techniques from the study of human colour vision, as well as field methods and theoretical interpretations drawn from linguistic anthropology.},

	abstract = {Colors are typically described by three values such as RGB, XYZ, and HSV. This is rooted to the fact that humans possess three types of photoreceptors under photopic conditions, and human color vision can be characterized by a set of three color matching functions (CMFs). CMFs integrate spectra to produce three colorimetric values that are related to visual responses. In reality, large variations in CMFs exist among color-normal populations. Thus, a pair of two spectrally different stimuli might be a match for one person but a mismatch for another person, also known as observer metamerism.
Observer metamerism is a serious issue in color-critical applications such as soft proofing in graphic arts and color grading in digital cinema, where colors are compared on different displays. Due to observer metamerism, calibrated displays might not appear correctly, and one person might disagree with color adjustments made by another person. The recent advent of wide color gamut display technologies (e.g., LEDs, OLEDs, lasers, and Quantum Dots) has made observer metamerism even more serious due to their spectrally narrow primaries. The variations among normal color vision and observer metamerism have been overlooked for many years. The current typical color imaging workflow uses a single standard observer assuming all the color-normal people possess the same CMFs. This dissertation provides a possible solution for observer metamerism in color-critical applications by personalized color imaging introducing individual colorimetric observers.
In this dissertation, at first, color matching data were collected to derive and validate CMFs for individual colorimetric observers. The data from 151 color-normal observers were obtained at four different locations. Second, two types of individual colorimetric observer functions were derived and validated. One is an individual colorimetric observer model, an extension of the CIE 2006 physiological observer incorporating eight physiological parameters to model individuals in addition to age and field size inputs. The other is a set of categorical observer functions providing a more convenient approach towards the personalized color imaging. Third, two workflows were proposed to characterize human color vision: one using a nomaloscope and the other using proposed spectral pseudoisochromatic images. Finally, the personalized color imaging was evaluated in a color image matching study on an LCD monitor and a laser projector and in a perceived color difference study on a SHARP Quattron display. The personalized color imaging was implemented using a newly introduced ICC profile, iccMAX.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to design the best lighting that will minimize long term photochemical degradation of Old Master Drawings and/or other works of art, while maintaining the patron's appreciation of the object's color and detail. The present approach is a technological refinement to the basic underlying earlier work on fluorescent lighting by W. A. Thornton, W.A. at General Electric1. Thin-film dielectric, multi-coating technology is used to create filters that eliminate ultraviolet light, near infrared light and significant unnecessary parts from the visible spectrum, thus maximizing the reduction in photochemical degradation, while maintaining optimal color rendering. Three interference filters, were designed and manufactured successfully. The filters are designated Mark 1, Mark 2, \& Mark 3. In this dissertation, the filters are analyzed with regard to their performance parameters. This includes color rendering, retardation in fading or color change, beam angle effects, filter stability, perceived brightness, and visual appreciation parameters.
To a high confidence level, all three filters are perceived as being indistinguishable from Unfiltered light with regard to the color confusion index parameter (CCI). Subjective assessments by tests subjects suggest the Mark 3 filter may display some distinguishability with a confidence level for distinguishability of 35\% for the overall satisfaction parameter. The Mark 3 filter is the most complex three-color type spectral profile and this might be expected due to beam angle effects or departures in accuracy of color theory. Beam angle affects suggest that the Mark 1 and Mark 2 filters do not display significant color rendering aberrations due to Newton's colors interference effects, except possibly at the periphery of the broadest (55-60+°) beam angle lamps.
Filtered and Unfiltered light are effectively of the same perceived brightness, though to a low confidence level, Unfiltered light might be perceived brighter. Accelerated aging studies of the filters indicate useful mean time before failures of {\textgreater}20 years. In fact, no failure was observed in any of the accelerated studies, The Mark 2 and Mark 3 filters were evaluated in equal-luminosity studies with regard to their effect on limiting fading of both standard fading samples such as the ISO Blue Wool series, and also other commercial pigments or stains. Within experimental error, the Mark 2 filter either slowed fading or had no effect on fading for all pigments relative to Unfiltered light and Optivex® filtered light, Optivex® being a common commercial filter used to protect works of art. Mark 3 protected in many cases, but for some pigments it was less protective than Optivex® filtered light. This failure is interpreted in terms of the wavelength dependence of the excess light in certain wavelength regions on an equal luminosity condition, and suggests that more subtle wavelength dependent optimizations have to be undertaken for filters which possess significant band separation.},

Each colour was assessed by a panel of five observers using a magnitude estimation method under three light sources, D65, TL84, and A. In total, 10,770 estimations were made, and these form a set of new colour appearance data in textiles. Data analysis was carried out and shows that the accuracy of the visual results for different observers is quite good. the colour appearance data were used to test the performance of seven chromatic-adaptation transformations, i.e., BFD, Bartleson, von Kries, CIE, Hunt, CIEL*a*b*, and Fairchild. the results show that the BFD transformation gives the most accurate prediction to the visual results between all transformations studied. All transformations can have a better fit to the experimental grid under TL84 than that under A. However, the results given by the best chromatic-adaptation transformation are still unsatisfied in colour industries, especially in the textile industry. the two sets of experimental grids respectively derived from this work and by Luo et al. (1991) were also studied. an expected difference between the two sets of experimental grids was found. the difference may mainly result from two factors: the experimental method in assessment and the size of the samples. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {The authors propose a method of image rendering to predict the incomplete chromatic-adaptation effect for paintings. A simple model of incomplete chromatic adaptation is developed to predict the appearance of the paintings under the illumination of an incandescent light source and to produce the full color image on a display device. The authors extend the von Kries framework to incomplete chromatic adaptation. An index parameter representing the degree of incomplete chromatic adaptation is defined based on the color temperature of the black-body radiators. First, the optimum value of the index parameter is determined by visual experiments on memory matching using real paintings and color patches, so that the color image produced on the display is matched to the original appearance of objects in a real scene. This approach is shown to have better performance in comparison with the traditional CIECAM02. Next, an algorithm is presented to estimate the index parameter of the incomplete adaptation index based on the image data of colorimetric rendering for a target painting. It is found that the index parameter can be estimated using only three features extracted from the color image. The color images rendered with the estimated parameter are used to predict the incomplete chromatic-adaptation effect for the original painting under the incandescent light source. The feasibility of the proposed method is confirmed based on a series of experiments using a variety of paintings. © 2014 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

Besides a simultaneous presentation of standard and test illuminants, we also carried out an experiment in which the illuminants were presented successively. The results were similar to Arend and Reeves’s; however, in the object-matching condition of the successive experiment, we found an overestimation, instead of an underestimation, of the illuminant component. Because the results of matching experiments are difficult to interpret, mainly due to their sensitivity to instruction effects, we introduced another type of color-constancy task. In this task, subjects simply named the color of a simulated patch. It was found that, by applying such a task, a reliable measure of the degree of identification of object color can be obtained.},

	abstract = {Recently, a group including the present authors developed a new color rendering (fidelity) measure, approved by the IES and henceforth referred to as IES Rf, that has two major updates with respect to the general color rendering index Ra of the CIE. First, it proposes an update to the more perceptually uniform CAM02-UCS color space. Secondly, instead of using only a small number (eight) of moderately saturated samples to determine a general color fidelity index, the IES method proposes using a set of 99 samples uniformly distributed in color space. In addition to the latter, the sample set has one other important property: spectral uniformity. This ensures that the sample set is not wavelength biased: all wavelengths contribute equivalently to the general color fidelity score. This article explores the importance of these two updates for color fidelity evaluation. It shows how the color space update results in a substantial spread of the new color fidelity scores relative to the old CIE Ra values and how the sample set update results in an overall reduction of color fidelity scores for most light source spectra with high CIE Ra (≥80) and high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) values, especially those with narrowband or spiked spectral features. It is shown that calculated color fidelity scores are affected by the degree of sample set spectral uniformity and that, in the absence of sample set spectral uniformity, light source spectra can be tuned to yield anomalously high CIE Ra values without necessarily yielding an increase in actual perceived color fidelity.},

One of the main assumptions advocated in this article is that the structure of color categories originates from the statistical structure of the perceived color environment that was observed throughout an individual's life. The perceived color environment can be modeled as color statistics of natural images in some perceptual and approximately uniform color space (e.g., the CIELUV color space). The process of color categorization can be modeled as the grouping of the color statistics by clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). The proposed computational model enables one to predict the location, rank, and number of color categories. The model is examined on the basis of K-means clustering analysis of statistics of 630 natural images in the CIELUV color space. In general, the model predictions are consistent with data from psycholinguistic studies. The model might be applied in different areas of imaging science such as color quantization, image quality, and gamut mapping.},

In history museums, a number of interpretive materials are necessary to present a specific historical theme. However, due to limitation of space, the number of displayed materials is severely restricted. There are various types of guidance systems in museums, however, most systems have not yet responded to visitors' needs. Therefore, a useful guidance system is necessary to satisfy their needs and also to enhance their understandings of the exhibitions. In order to create such guidance system, applications of imaging technology can become a solution to overcome these restrictions and meet the requirements. In this research, a visual guidance system using a data projector was examined in the National Museum of Japanese History. In the kimono (traditional Japanese clothing) section, the projector was used to simulate color changes of the materials under different illuminants. The projector also highlighted areas where annotations were featured in the kimono. The validity of using the projector system was confirmed by results from an interview survey. To further develop this visual guidance system, an augmented reality system consisted of cooperation between the projector and a digital camera was also examined.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with designing light source spectra for optimum luminous efficacy and colour rendering. We demonstrate that it is possible to design light sources that can provide both good colour rendering and high luminous efficacy by combining the outputs of a number of narrowband spectral constituents. Also, the achievable results depend on the numbers and wavelengths of the different spectral bands utilized in the mixture. Practical realization of these concepts has been demonstrated in this pilot study which combines a number of simulations with tests using real LEDs (light emitting diodes). Such sources are capable of providing highly efficient lighting systems with good energy conservation potential. Further research is underway to investigate the practicalities of our proposals in relation to large-scale light source production.},

Therefore, we present an approach based on color features that takes into account the spatial relationship between coloured regions. This metric works on the whole image by using an algorithm of regions extraction and another exploiting adjacent matrix. Different algorithms of regions extraction are implemented (classification and segmentation) to raise the importance of this step inside the no-reference metric and to know where this regions extraction is needed, either in the input image or in the perceveid (output) image. Finally, the metric correlates in a significant manner with the subjective results.},

We introduce a model for optimal color reproduction of natural scenes which is based on the assumption that color quality of natural images is constrained by perceived naturalness and colorfulness of these images. To verify the model, a few experimentswere carried out where subjects estimated the perceived ‘naturalness’, ‘colorfulness’ and ‘quality’ of images of natural scenes. The judgments were related to statistical parameters of the color point distribution across the images in the CIELUV color space. It was found that the perceptually optimal color reproduction can be derived from this statistic within the framework of our model. We specify naturalness, colorfulness and quality indices, describing the observer's judgments. Finally, an algorithm for optimizing perceived quality of color reproduction of natural scenes is discussed.},

A comparative analysis of within-scenes and between-scenes colourfulness assessments was performed. Images were created by varying chroma in the CIELUV colour space while lightness and hue-angle were kept constant. Experiment 1 shows the results of a multidimensional analysis of the differences-scaling in perceived colourfulness. Experiment 2 includes a unidimensional investigation of the direct-scaling of the magnitude of perceived colourfulness. Both experiments confirm that colourfulness judgments highly correlate with a linear combination of the mean of the distribution of chroma values and its standard deviation. That was also verified in Experiment 3 with “Mondrian”-like stimuli (spatially scrambled versions of the images of natural scenes). Colourfulness judgments of natural scenes, but not “Mondrian”-like scenes, brought out systematic differences between observers. In order to interpret and quantify these differences, a model of individual strategies in colourfulness judgments is developed and discussed.},

Primate colour vision is traditionally believed to have evolved for finding food in the forest. Recent work has tested the ecological importance of trichromacy to primates, both by measuring the spectral and chemical properties of food eaten in the wild, and by testing the relative foraging abilities of dichromatic and trichromatic primates. Molecular studies have revealed the genetic mechanisms of the evolution of trichromacy, and are providing new insight into visual pigment gene expression and colour vision defects. By drawing together work from these different fields, we can gain a better understanding of how natural selection has shaped the evolution of trichromatic colour vision in primates and also about mechanisms of gene duplication, heterozygote advantage and balancing selection.},

	abstract = {Although trichromacy in Old and New World primates is based on three visual pigments with spectral peaks in the violet (SW, shortwave), green (MW, middlewave) and yellow–green (LW, longwave) regions of the spectrum, the underlying genetic mechanisms differ. The SW pigment is encoded in both cases by an autosomal gene and, in Old World primates, the MW and LW pigments by separate genes on the X chromosome. In contrast, there is a single polymorphic X-linked gene in most New World primates with three alleles coding for spectrally distinct pigments. The one reported exception to this rule is the New World howler monkey that follows the Old World system of separate LW and MW genes. A comparison of gene sequences in these different genetic systems indicates that the duplication that gave rise to the separate MW and LW genes of Old World primates is more ancient than that in the howler monkey. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the two howler monkey pigments show similarities to the pigments encoded by the polymorphic gene of other New World primates. It would appear therefore that the howler monkey gene duplication arose after the split between New and Old World primates and was generated by an unequal crossover that placed two different forms of the New World polymorphic gene on to a single chromosome. In contrast, the lack of identity at variable sites within the New and Old World systems argues for the origin of the separate genes in Old World primates by the duplication of a single form of the gene followed by divergence to give spectrally distinct LW and MW pigments. In contrast, the similarity in amino acid variation across the tri-allelic system of New World primates indicates that this polymorphism had a single origin in New World primates. A striking feature of all these pigments is the use of a common set of substitutions at three amino acid sites to achieve the spectral shift from MW at around 530 nm to LW at around 560 nm. The separate origin of the trichromacy in New and Old World primates would indicate that the selection of these three sites is the result of convergent evolution, perhaps as a consequence of visual adaptation in both cases to foraging for yellow and orange fruits against a green foliage.},

	abstract = {Trichromacy in all Old World primates is dependent on separate X-linked MW and LW opsin genes that are organized into a head-to-tail tandem array flanked on the upstream side by a locus control region (LCR). The 5′ regions of these two genes show homology for only the first 236 bp, although within this region, the differences are conserved in humans, chimpanzees, and two species of cercopithecoid monkeys. In contrast, most New World primates have only a single polymorphic X-linked opsin gene; all males are dichromats and trichromacy is achieved only in those females that possess a different form of this gene on each X chromosome. By sequencing the upstream region of this gene in a New World monkey, the marmoset, we have been able to demonstrate the presence of an LCR in an equivalent position to that in Old World primates. Moreover, the marmoset sequence shows extensive homology from the coding region to the LCR with the upstream sequence of the human LW gene, a distance of {\textgreater}3 kb, whereas homology with the human MW gene is again limited to the first 236 bp, indicating that the divergent MW sequence identifies the site of insertion of the duplicated gene. This is further supported by the presence of an incomplete Alu element on the upstream side of this insertion point in the MW gene of both humans and a cercopithecoid monkey, with additional Alu elements present further upstream. Therefore, these Aluelements may have been involved in the initial gene duplication and may also be responsible for the high frequency of gene loss and gene duplication within the opsin gene array. Full trichromacy is present in one species of New World monkey, the howler monkey, in which separate MW and LW genes are again present. In contrast to the separate genes in humans, however, the upstream sequences of the two howler genes show homology with the marmoset for at least 600 bp, which is well beyond the point of divergence of the human MW and LW genes, and each sequence is associated with a different LCR, indicating that the duplication in the howler monkey involved the entire upstream region.

Tuning light source SPD to better match the sensitivity of visual perception may allow the same spatial brightness but at lower illuminance with potential reductions in energy consumption. Consideration of experimental design was used to review 70 studies of spatial brightness. Of these, the 19 studies considered to provide credible evidence of SPD effects were used to explore metrics for predicting the effect of SPD but did not provide conclusive evidence of a suitable metric, in part because of incomplete reporting of SPD characteristics. For future work, these data provide an independent database for validating proposed metrics.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether spatial cone-excitation ratios are preserved under illuminant changes within the natural visual environment. A fast hyperspectral imaging system was used to obtain populations of 640,000 reflectance spectra from each of 30 natural scenes. The statistics of spatial cone-excitation ratios for randomly selected pairs of points in these scenes were determined for two extreme daylights. Almost-invariant ratios were common, suggesting that they represent a reliable property of the natural visual environment and a suitable foundation for visual color constancy.},

An attempt has been made to cover a variety of models and show their fundamental relationships to each other. The models described in the chapter are von Kries model, MacAdam's model, Nayatani's model, Guth's model, and Fairchild's 1990 model. The models do allow the computation of corresponding colors, but they are not color appearance models. They are quite useful in predicting color matches across changes in viewing conditions. This is a significant extension of tristimulus colorimetry, all that is necessary in some applications, and the fundamental basis upon which all color appearance models are constructed.

	abstract = {Colour constancy is traditionally interpreted as the stable appearance of the colour of a surface despite changes in the spectral composition of the illumination. When colour constancy has been assessed quantitatively, however, by observers making matches between surfaces illuminated by different sources, its completeness has been found to be poor. An alternative operational approach to colour constancy may he taken which concentrates instead on detecting the underlying chromatic relationship between the parts of a surface under changes in the illuminant. Experimentally the observer's task was to determine whether a change in the appearance of a surface was due to a change in its reflecting properties or to a change in the incident light. Observers viewed computer simulations of a row of three Mondrian patterns of Munsell chips. The centre pattern was a reference pattern illuminated by a simulated, spatially uniform daylight; one of the outer patterns was identical but illuminated by a different daylight; and the other outer pattern was equivalent but not obtainable from the centre pattern by such a change in illuminant. Different patterns and different shifts in daylight were generated in each experimental trial. The task of the observer was to identify which of the outer patterns was the result of an illuminant change. Observers made reliable discriminations of the patterns with displays of durations from several seconds to less than 200 ms, and for one observer, with displays of 1 ms. By these measures, human observers appear capable of colour constancy that is extremely rapid, and probably preattentive in origin.},

	abstract = {When the illumination on a scene changes, so do the visual signals elicited by that scene. In spite of these changes, the objects within a scene tend to remain constant in their apparent colour. We start this review by discussing the psychophysical procedures that have been used to quantify colour constancy. The transformation imposed on the visual signals by a change in illumination dictates what the visual system must ‘undo’ to achieve constancy. The problem is mathematically underdetermined, and can be solved only by exploiting regularities of the visual world. The last decade has seen a substantial increase in our knowledge of such regularities as technical advances have made it possible to make empirical measurements of large numbers of environmental scenes and illuminants. This review provides a taxonomy of models of human colour constancy based first on the assumptions they make about how the inverse transformation might be simplified, and second, on how the parameters of the inverse transformation might be set by elements of a complex scene. Candidate algorithms for human colour constancy are represented graphically and pictorially, and the availability and utility of an accurate estimate of the illuminant is discussed. Throughout this review, we consider both the information that is, in principle, available and empirical assessments of what information the visual system actually uses. In the final section we discuss where in our visual systems these computations might be implemented.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of colour constancy in human visual perception keeps surface colours constant, despite changes in their reflected light due to changing illumination. Although colour constancy has evolved under a constrained subset of illuminations, it is unknown whether its underlying mechanisms, thought to involve multiple components from retina to cortex, are optimised for particular environmental variations. Here we demonstrate a new method for investigating colour constancy using illumination matching in real scenes which, unlike previous methods using surface matching and simulated scenes, allows testing of multiple, real illuminations. We use real scenes consisting of solid familiar or unfamiliar objects against uniform or variegated backgrounds and compare discrimination performance for typical illuminations from the daylight chromaticity locus (approximately blue-yellow) and atypical spectra from an orthogonal locus (approximately red-green, at correlated colour temperature 6700 K), all produced in real time by a 10-channel LED illuminator. We find that discrimination of illumination changes is poorer along the daylight locus than the atypical locus, and is poorest particularly for bluer illumination changes, demonstrating conversely that surface colour constancy is best for blue daylight illuminations. Illumination discrimination is also enhanced, and therefore colour constancy diminished, for uniform backgrounds, irrespective of the object type. These results are not explained by statistical properties of the scene signal changes at the retinal level. We conclude that high-level mechanisms of colour constancy are biased for the blue daylight illuminations and variegated backgrounds to which the human visual system has typically been exposed.},

	abstract = {Color constancy is the skill by which it is possible to tell the color of an object even under a colored light. I interpret the color of an object as its color under a fixed canonical light, rather than as a surface reflectance function. This leads to an analysis that shows two distinct sets of circumstances under which color constancy is possible. In this framework, color constancy requires estimating the illuminant under which the image was taken. The estimate is then used to choose one of a set of linear maps, which is applied to the image to yield a color descriptor at each point. This set of maps is computed in advance. The illuminant can be estimated using image measurements alone, because, given a number of weak assumptions detailed in the text, the color of the illuminant is constrained by the colors observed in the image. This constraint arises from the fact that surfaces can reflect no more light than is cast on them. For example, if one observes a patch that excites the red receptor strongly, the illuminant cannot have been deep blue. Two algorithms are possible using this constraint, corresponding to different assumptions about the world. The first algorithm, Crule will work for any surface reflectance. Crule corresponds to a form of coefficient rule, but obtains the coefficients by using constraints on illuminant color. The set of illuminants for which Crule will be successful depends strongly on the choice of photoreceptors: for narrowband photoreceptors, Crule will work in an unrestricted world. The second algorithm, Mwext, requires that both surface reflectances and illuminants be chosen from finite dimensional spaces; but under these restrictive conditions it can recover a large number of parameters in the illuminant, and is not an attractive model of human color constancy. Crule has been tested on real images of Mondriaans, and works well. I show results for Crule and for the Retinex algorithm of Land (Land 1971; Land 1983; Land 1985) operating on a number of real images. The experimental work shows that for good constancy, a color constancy system will need to adjust the gain of the receptors it employs in a fashion analagous to adaptation in humans.},

In Part I we repeated that experiment, quantifying the color sensations for each of the many Mondrian areas. In Part II we show that each area's color sensation correlates with a triplet of reflectances measured with photodetectors having the same spectral sensitivities as the cone pigments in the eye. This result provides a description of what the visual system does, but it does not provide a mechanism for how the visual system can do it because the reflectance measurements required the use of a reflectance standard and unchanging illumination. In Part III we describe a model for color sensations that computes three reflectances from the wavelength-radiance distribution without reflectance or illumination standards: hence, it is able to predict the color sensations seen by the observer. The model is able to predict gray, red. yellow, green and blue sensations associated with areas that send identical wavelength-radiance distributions to the eye.},

This leads to paradoxical adaptation predictions for the colors that have negative Von Kries coordinates. A solution is proposed here that expresses the asymmetric-matching relation of chromatic adaptation as the product of two matrix transformations, given source illuminant 1 and destination illuminant 2: from source tristimulus values via adaptation matrix 1 to the adapted state coordinates, and from the adapted state via the inverse of adaptation matrix 2 to the destination illuminant tristimulus values. To avoid the sharpening instability, the entire spectrum locus must lie within the positive octant of the adapted state tristimulus space. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At about the same time, new models of color constancy appeared, along with physiological data on cortical mechanisms and photographic colorimetric measurements of natural scenes. Since then, as this review shows, there have been many advances. The theoretical requirements for constancy have been better delineated and the range of experimental techniques has been greatly expanded; novel invariant properties of images and a variety of neural mechanisms have been identified; and increasing recognition has been given to the relevance of natural surfaces and scenes as laboratory stimuli. Even so, there remain many theoretical and experimental challenges, not least to develop an account of color constancy that goes beyond deterministic and relatively simple laboratory stimuli and instead deals with the intrinsically variable nature of surfaces and illuminations present in the natural world.},

	abstract = {The eminence of Herbert Eugene Ives has been a cascading influence over color science, and particularly over activities in the CIE, throughout this century. Ives is well known for having been the first to measure the luminosity function, nine years before Guild's measurements became the basis of the first CIE standard. He also represented in explicit equation form the algebra of transforming primaries in trstimulus space and representing the transformation in projective chromaticity coordinates. [Ives was not the first to discuss such transformations, for they had been implicit in Grassmann's laws and in Maxwell's color triangle since the middle of the nineteenth century. However, he rendered the rather abstract geometry into a form readily accessible to engineers.] In addition, Ives was a pioneer in the art and science of simulating daylight byplacing filters in front of tungsten illumination sources. Finally, about thirty years ahead of his time, Ives anticipated the Fourier approach to timedependence in vision. However, a lesser-known achievement of Ives was his contribution to the technology and assessment of color rendering by light sources. In particular, this work comprised what may be the first computational test of von Kries's theory of color constancy. This early work, which contained a startling number of the in gredients of modern work in color constancy, is reprinted as this month's Classical Article. Ives had neither good standard apparatus for measuring spectral reflectance, nor the convenience of a computer. Therefore, he invented piecewise-constant reflectance spectra that were plausible in the sense of having values between 0.1 and 1, and three or fewer transitions across the visible spectrum (see Fig. 3). to obtain reflected-light tristimulus values in the absence of CIE color-matching functions, he first multiplied Koenig's sprimary-sensation curves by two illuminant spectral power distributions (see Fig. 1) to get what Worthey called much later “object-color matching functions.” He then summed the values over wavelength, weighted by the block reflectances, to obtain the tristimulus values. the differences in chromaticity for the same reflectance under the two different illuminants are recorded in Fig. 4 as “colorimetric shifts.” Although these colorimetric shifts are mathematically definite and useful quantities to compute, Ives realized that, in themselves, they do not represent changes in color percepts under change of illumination. Rather, the visual system undergoes an adaptation to the prevailing illumination that transforms the measured chromaticities of reflected lights to other values. This transformation implements Helmholtz's “discounting of the illuminant,” an attempt of the visual system to restore the visual representation of object reflectances to illuminant-independent positions in the space of perceived colors. As a particular way to discount the illuminant (and hence to achieve what is known as color constancy), Ives chose to divide each tristimulus value of a reflected light by the corresponding tristimulus value of a white (with a reflectance of 1 across the spectrum). This algorithm, an application of von Kries's model of chromatic adaptation,6,7 certainly sends the illuminant unerringly to the point (1, 1, 1), independent of the spectrum of the illuminant. However, the algorithm does not perform of satisfactorily on other reflectance spectra. Although the colorimetric shifts are reduced by the von Kries adaptation, there are still residual shifts (see Fig. 5). This kind of analysis is quite revealing of the limitations of color constancy, especially constancy of the von Kries sort. an analysis of the same sort on measured reflectance spectra was not done until the work of Helson, et al. in 1952. Other analyses followed, stimulated by the retinex theory of Edwin Land and including the work of McCann, McKee, and Taylor and Worthey. of course, the question remained unanswered and hotly debated as to how the visual system infers the tristimulus values of the white object that it uses as the denominator in the von Kries adaptation; this has been discussed by Land, McCann, and Brainard and Wandell, among others. Another question is to define the spectral assumptions (for illuminants, reflectances, and color-matching functions) under which the colorimetric shifts would reduce to zero for nonwhite reflectances. Much has been written in this area, including the following kinds of assumptions: (a) reflectances, color-matching functions, and illuminant spectra that are piecewise constant over the same bands in the visible spectrum; (b) very narrowband color-matching functions, but unconstrained illuminants and reflectances;16,17 (c) reflectance spectra that are designed to avoid a “forbidden subspace” dictated by the (unconstrained) illuminant spectra and color-matching functions; and finally (d) reflectance and illuminant spectra that must be linear combinations of two and three basis functions (respectively), or the reverse, and the measured color-matching functions are linearly combined to achieve the von Kries invariance.19,20 Other simulations have also been done with models different from that of von Kries, starting with Helson, et al., and commencing with more modern theories.22,23,24 (See Pokorny, et al. for an excellent review of the more modern theories.) Such is the legacy of the article by Ives. The reader of Ives's article will note the claim to priority at the beginning of the second paragraph. to my best knowledge, this claim is true, and can be trusted even though Ives has not referred to any prior investigators by explicit citation (even to the article by Koenig or to the theory of von Kries). the reader will also note that the author refers to his own ongoing work in daylight simulation using filters that was to appear two years later in finished form. However, I have learned from Calvin McCamy of earlier work on daylight design that was not referenced by Ives.27,28 Perhaps Ives viewed his article as apractical note for engineers rather than as a scholarly tract. A historical question I have not yet completely resolved is whether von Kries viewed his transformation as a vehicle to Helmholtz's discounting of the illuminant, or whether von Kries viewed his transformation merely as offering degrees of freedom that would reveal the particular linear combination of color-matching functions that are receptor fundamentals. If the latter were true, then Ives may have been the first to use the von Kries transformation in a theory of color constancy. the Englishtranslated von Kries articles with which we are familiar do not discuss color constancy. History seems to have given only rare acknowledgment to Ives's “Color of the illuminant” article. In fact, it was only by reading the scholarly review in Helson, et al. that I became aware of the article at all. the reason for this paucity of acknowledgment can hardly be Ives's lack of eminence in his own time. Rather, it seems that his methodology in this particular article was well ahead of its time, even by the standards of his other early work that presaged the methods of the CIE. Readers who are interested in more complete accounts of the life and accomplishments of Herbert E. Ives may consult the testimonial upon his receipt of the Ives medal (named after his father, and given by the Optical Society of America), and also might find helpful the journal obituary. In particular, Ives was quite critical of Einstein's theory; he published over 30 papers about relativity starting the year he received the Ives medal, which have been reprinted with commentary. His publication list includes subjects as diverse as television, spectroscopy and Special Relativity. Much more could be written in a more generalized context about the contributions of Herbert E. Ives.},

	abstract = {Background: The perceived color at each point in a visual scene depends on the relationship between light signals from that point, and light signals from surrounding areas of the scene. In the well known phenomenon of simultaneous color contrast, changing the overall brightness or hue of an object's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived brightness or hue of the object's color. Color contrast is thought to contribute to color constancy with changes in illumination.

Results: We report a new type of simultaneous color contrast, in which changing only the variance (i.e. contrasts and saturations), but not the mean, of colors in a test spot's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived contrast and saturation of the test spot's color. Objects appear much more vivid and richly colored against low-contrast, gray surrounds than against high-contrast, multicolored surrounds.

Conclusions: Color appearance depends not just on the mean color of the surround, but also on the distribution of surround colors about the mean. This novel form of simultaneous color contrast is inconsistent with a variety of models of color appearance, including those based on sensitivity regulation at the receptor level, and those in which the effects of complex surrounds on color appearance can be reduced to adaptation to the illuminant or induction from a homogeneous ‘equivalent surround’. It tends to normalize the gamut of perceived colors in each visual scene and may also contribute to color constancy under viewing conditions that affect contrast.},

The long history of color preference studies has been described as “bewildering, confused and contradictory” [1]. Although recent studies [1–3] tend to agree on a universal preference for ‘blue’, the variety and lack of control in measurement methods have made it difficult to extract a systematic, quantitative description of preference. Furthermore, despite abundant evidence for sex differences in other visual domains, and specifically in other tasks of color perception [4,5], there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of sex differences in color preference. This fact is perhaps surprising, given the prevalence and longevity of the notion that little girls differ from boys in preferring ‘pink’ [6]. Here we report a robust, cross-cultural sex difference in color preference, revealed by a rapid paired-comparison task. Individual color preference patterns are summarized by weights on the two fundamental neural dimensions that underlie color coding in the human visual system. We find a consistent sex difference in these weights, which, we suggest, may be linked to the evolution of sex-specific behavioral uses of trichromacy.},

	abstract = {Color constancy — by which objects tend to appear the same color under changes in illumination — is most likely achieved by several mechanisms, operating at different levels in the visual system. One powerful contributory mechanism is simultaneous spatial color contrast. Under changes in natural illumination the spatial ratios of within-type cone excitations between natural surfaces tend to be preserved (Foster and Nascimento, 1994); therefore, the neural encoding of colors as spatial contrasts tends to achieve constancy. Several factors are known to influence the strength of chromatic contrast induction between surfaces, including their relative luminance, spatial scale, spatial configuration and context (Ware and Cowan, 1982; Zaidi et al., 1991). Here we test the hypothesis that color contrast is weakened by differences between surfaces which indicate that they may be under distinct illuminants. We summarize psychophysical measurements of the effects of relative motion, relative depth and texture differences on chromatic contrast induction. Of these factors, only texture differences between surfaces weaken chromatic contrast induction. We also consider neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence and conclude that the mechanisms which mediate local chromatic contrast effects are sited at low levels in the visual system, in primary visual cortex (V1) or below, prior to image segmentation mechanisms which require computation of relative depth or motion. V1 and lower areas may therefore play a larger role in color constancy than previously thought.},

To solve the colour constancy problem we estimate the colour of the prevailing light and then, at the second stage, remove it.Two of the most commonly used simple techniques for estimating the colour of the light are the Grey-World and Max-RGB algorithms. In this paper we begin by observing that this two colour constancy computations will respectively return the right answer if the average scene colour is grey or the maximum is white (and conversely, the degree of failure is proportional to the extent that these assumptions hold). We go on to ask the following question: “Would we perform better colour constancy by assuming the scene average is some shade of grey?”. We give a mathematical answer to this question. Firstly, we show that Max-RGB and Grey-World are two instantiations of Minkowski norm. Secondly, that for a large calibrated dataset L 6 norm colour constancy works best overall (we have improved the performance achieved by a simple normalization based approach). Surprisingly we found performance to be similar to more elaborated algorithm.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
In bright light, mammals use a distinct photopigment (melanopsin) to measure irradiance for centrally mediated responses such as circadian entrainment. We aimed to determine whether the information generated by melanopsin is also used by the visual system as a signal for light adaptation. To this end, we compared retinal and thalamic responses to a range of artificial and natural visual stimuli presented using spectral compositions that either approximate the mouse’s experience of natural daylight (“daylight”) or are selectively depleted of wavelengths to which melanopsin is most sensitive (“mel-low”).
Results
We found reproducible and reversible changes in the flash electroretinogram between daylight and mel-low. Simultaneous recording in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) revealed that these reflect changes in feature selectivity of visual circuits in both temporal and spatial dimensions. A substantial fraction of units preferred finer spatial patterns in the daylight condition, while the population of direction-sensitive units became tuned to faster motion. The dLGN contained a richer, more reliable encoding of natural scenes in the daylight condition. These effects were absent in mice lacking melanopsin.
Conclusions
The feature selectivity of many neurons in the mouse dLGN is adjusted according to a melanopsin-dependent measure of environmental brightness. These changes originate, at least in part, within the retina. Melanopsin performs a role analogous to a photographer’s light meter, providing an independent measure of irradiance that determines optimal setting for visual circuits.},

	abstract = {Many animals use the spectral distribution of light to guide behaviour, but whether they have colour vision has been debated for over a century. Our strong subjective experience of colour and the fact that human vision is the paradigm for colour science inevitably raises the question of how we compare with other species. This article outlines four grades of ‘colour vision’ that can be related to the behavioural uses of spectral information, and perhaps to the underlying mechanisms. In the first, even without an (image-forming) eye, simple organisms can compare photoreceptor signals to locate a desired light environment. At the next grade, chromatic mechanisms along with spatial vision guide innate preferences for objects such as food or mates; this is sometimes described as wavelength-specific behaviour. Here, we compare the capabilities of di- and trichromatic vision, and ask why some animals have more than three spectral types of receptors. Behaviours guided by innate preferences are then distinguished from a grade that allows learning, in part because the ability to learn an arbitrary colour is evidence for a neural representation of colour. The fourth grade concerns colour appearance rather than colour difference: for instance, the distinction between hue and saturation, and colour categorization. These higher-level phenomena are essential to human colour perception but poorly known in animals, and we suggest how they can be studied. Finally, we observe that awareness of colour and colour qualia cannot be easily tested in animals.},

	abstract = {Existing research in color naming and categorization primarily reflects two opposing views: A \textit{Cultural Relativist} view that posits color perception is greatly shaped by culturally specific language associations and perceptual learning, and a \textit{Universalist} view that emphasizes panhuman shared color processing as the basis for color naming similarities within and across cultures. Recent empirical evidence finds color processing differs both within and across cultures. This divergent color processing raises new questions about the sources of previously observed cultural coherence and cross-cultural universality. The present article evaluates the relevance of individual variation on the mainstream model of color naming. It also presents an alternate view that specifies how color naming and categorization is shaped by both panhuman cognitive universals and socio-cultural evolutionary processes. This alternative view, expressed, in part, using an \textit{Interpoint Distance Model} of color categorization, is compatible with new empirical results showing divergent color processing within and across cultures. It suggests that universalities in color naming and categorization may naturally arise across cultures because color language and color categories primarily reflect culturally modal linguistic mappings, and categories are shaped by universal cognitive constructs and culturally salient features of color. Thus, a shared cultural representation of color based on widely shared cognitive dimensions may be the proper foundation for universalities of color naming and categorization. Across cultures this form of representation may result from convergent responses to similar pressures on color lexicon evolution.},

	abstract = {Dichromatic subjects can name colors accurately, even though they cannot discriminate among red-green hues (Jameson \& Hurvich, 1978). This result is attributed to a normative language system that dichromatic observers developed by learning subtle visual cues to compensate for their impoverished color system. The present study used multidimensional scaling techniques to compare color categorization spaces of color-vision deficient (CVD) subjects to those of normal trichromat (NT) subjects, and consensus analysis estimated the normative effect of language on categorization. Subjects sorted 140 Munsell color samples in three different ways: a free sorting task (unlimited number of categories), a constrained sorting task (number of categories limited to eight), and a constrained naming task (limited to eight basic color terms). CVD color categories were comparable to those of NT subjects. For both CVD and NT subjects, a common color categorization space derived from the three tasks was well described by a three-dimensional model, with the first two dimensions corresponding to reddish-greenish and yellowish-bluish axes. However, the third axis, which was associated with an achromatic dimension in NTs, was not identified in the CVD model. Individual differences multidimensional scaling failed to reveal group differences in the sorting tasks. In contrast, the personal color naming spaces of CVD subjects exhibited a relative compression of the yellowish-bluish dimension that is inconsistent with the typical deutan-type color spaces derived from more direct measures of perceptual color judgments. As expected, the highest consensus among CVDs (77\%) and NTs (82\%) occurred in the naming task. The categorization behaviors studied in this experiment seemed to rely more on learning factors, and may reveal little about CVD perceptual representation of colors.},

In relation to this topic, we built a spectral LED-based tuneable light source for the reconstruction of CIE standard illuminants. This light source consists of 31 spectral channels from 400nm to 700nm, an integrating cube and a control board with 16 bit resolution. Moreover, a minimization routine was developed to calculate the weighting values per channel for reproducing standard illuminants. The differences in colorimetric and fitting parameters between standard spectra and the theoretical and experimental ones, showed that the reconstructed spectra were very similar to the standard ones, specially for the D65 and A illuminants. However, there was a certain mismatching from 500nm to 600nm due to the lack of LEDs in this region. In conclusion, the developed LED-based light source and minimization routine are able to reproduce CIE standard illuminants with high accuracy.},

Taking into account the natural spectral width of each of the LED wavelengths, a reasonably well-behaved and spike-free spectral continuum is demonstrated. The LED light source is based on a modular design that facilitates fabrication of arbitrarily large area simulators for both single solar cell and multi-cell module test and evaluation. The spectral tunability of this simulator makes it an attractive instrument for use in evaluating the performance of both conventional solar cells and tandem solar cells. The basic modular building block is a 10 cm x 10 cm “tile” consisting of the LED emitter platform with reflecting side mirrors and driver electronics conveniently located directly underneath the emitter platform in a compact yet flexible configuration. Combinations of tiles facilitate manufacture of solar simulators of arbitrarily large size and shape, with the advantages of high reliability, spectral tunability, lighter weight, no water cooling requirements and absence of high voltages. Excellent spectral mixing and intensity uniformity is obtained on the measurement plane, resulting in a simulator that meets Class AAA specifications according to ASTM and IEC standards.},

Amongst recent iPPG studies, two separate research directions have been revealed, i.e., scientific camera based imaging PPG (iPPG) and webcam based imaging PPG (wPPG). Little is known about the difference between these two techniques. To address this issue, a dual-channel imaging PPG system (iPPG and wPPG) using ambient light as the illumination source has been introduced in this study. The performance of the two imaging PPG techniques was evaluated through the measurement of cardiac pulse acquired from the face of 10 male subjects before and after 10 min of cycling exercise. A time-frequency representation method was used to visualize the time-dependent behaviour of the heart rate. In comparison to the gold standard contact PPG, both imaging PPG techniques exhibit comparable functional characteristics in the context of cardiac pulse assessment. Moreover, the synchronized ambient light intensity recordings in the present study can provide additional information for appraising the performance of the imaging PPG systems. This feasibility study thereby leads to a new route for non-contact monitoring of vital signs, with clear applications in triage and homecare.},

Fourteen sound and healthy female subjects (22–27 years of age) participated in the experiments. Each subject was told to keep a relaxed seating posture with no physical restriction.

The waveform of the photoplethysmographic image (PPGi) signals may be significantly affected by the light spectra and intensity. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of PPGi waveform acquisition in the red, green, and blue channels using a commercial camera in different light conditions. The system, developed for this paper, comprises of a commercial camera and light sources with varied spectra and intensities. Signals were acquired from the fingertips of 12 healthy subjects. Extensive experiments, using different wavelength lights and white light with variation light intensities, respectively, reported in this paper, showed that almost all light spectra can acquire acceptable pulse rates, but only 470-, 490-, 505-, 590-, 600-, 610-, 625-, and 660-nm wavelength lights showed better performance in PPGi waveform compared with gold standard. With lower light intensity, the light spectra {\textgreater}600 nm still showed better performance. The change in pulse amplitude (ac) and dc amplitude was also investigated with the different light intensity and light spectra. With increasing light intensity, the dc amplitude increased, whereas ac component showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. Most of the subjects achieved their maximum averaging ac output when averaging dc output was in the range from 180 to 220 pixel values (8 b, 255 maximum pixel value). The results suggested that an adaptive solution could be developed to optimize the design of PPGi-based physiological signal acquisition devices in different light conditions.},

	abstract = {Non-contact camera-based imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) is useful for measuring heart rate in conditions
where contact devices are problematic due to issues such as mobility, comfort, and sanitation. Existing iPPG
methods analyse the light-tissue interaction of either active or passive (ambient) illumination. Many active
iPPG methods assume the incident ambient light is negligible to the active illumination, resulting in high power
requirements, while many passive iPPG methods assume near-constant ambient conditions. These assumptions
can only be achieved in environments with controlled illumination and thus constrain the use of such devices. To
increase the number of possible applications of iPPG devices, we propose a dual-mode active iPPG system that is
robust to changes in ambient illumination variations. Our system uses a temporally-coded illumination sequence
that is synchronized with the camera to measure both active and ambient illumination interaction for determining
heart rate. By subtracting the ambient contribution, the remaining illumination data can be attributed to the
controlled illuminant. Our device comprises a camera and an LED illuminant controlled by a microcontroller.
The microcontroller drives the temporal code via synchronizing the frame captures and illumination time at the
hardware level. By simulating changes in ambient light conditions, experimental results show our device is able
to assess heart rate accurately in challenging lighting conditions. By varying the temporal code, we demonstrate
the trade-off between camera frame rate and ambient light compensation for optimal blood pulse detection.},

The pulse signal is obtained based on the method of Photoplethysmography (PPG). We use a LED as the light source and a photoelectric diode as the receiver to get a measured pulse wave. Because the pulse wave obtained by this method is easily disturbed by motion artifact, we use an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to aid PPG measurement. Firstly, the ECG signal is processed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and get the heart rate. Secondly, with the value of heart rate, a typical noise free pulse waveform can be constructed. Finally, we use it as a reference input to get a recovered pulse wave by the theory of lock-in amplifier. Thus, the value of oxygen saturation can be calculated accurately through two recovered pulse waveforms of red (660nm) and infrared (940nm) light. Some volunteers were tested. The correlation coefficient between the experimental data and the data provided by a reference instrument is 0.98, proving that this method has high reliability and utility in motion.},

Most of the papers in the literature on non-contact vital sign monitoring report results on human volunteers in controlled environments. We have been able to obtain estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate and preliminary results on changes in oxygen saturation from double-monitored patients undergoing haemodialysis in the Oxford Kidney Unit. To achieve this, we have devised a novel method of cancelling out aliased frequency components caused by artificial light flicker, using auto-regressive (AR) modelling and pole cancellation. Secondly, we have been able to construct accurate maps of the spatial distribution of heart rate and respiratory rate information from the coefficients of the AR model. In stable sections with minimal patient motion, the mean absolute error between the camera-derived estimate of heart rate and the reference value from a pulse oximeter is similar to the mean absolute error between two pulse oximeter measurements at different sites (finger and earlobe). The activities of daily living affect the respiratory rate, but the camera-derived estimates of this parameter are at least as accurate as those derived from a thoracic expansion sensor (chest belt). During a period of obstructive sleep apnoea, we tracked changes in oxygen saturation using the ratio of normalized reflectance changes in two colour channels (red and blue), but this required calibration against the reference data from a pulse oximeter.},

The instantaneous amplitude modulations present in heart rate (AMHR) and breathing rate (AMBR) band frequencies of PPG were extracted from high-resolution time-frequency spectrum. HR and pulse pressure showed no significant changes during the protocol. The AMHR significantly (P{\textless};0.05) decreased at 100 ml through 900 ml blood loss from ear and finger probe sites. The mean percent decrease in AMHR at 900 ml blood loss compared to baseline value was 45.2\%, 42.0\%, and 42.3\% for ear, finger and forehead PPG signals, respectively. In addition, significant increases in AMBR were found due to blood loss in ear and finger PPG signals.

	abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and associated with adverse health outcomes. Timely detection of AF can be challenging using traditional diagnostic tools. Smartphone use is increasing and may provide an inexpensive and user-friendly means to diagnoseAF.
Objective
To test the hypothesis that a smartphone-based application could detect an irregular pulse fromAF.
Methods
Seventy-six adults with persistent AF were consented for participation in our study. We obtained pulsatile time series recordings before and after cardioversion using an iPhone 4S camera. A novel smartphone application conducted real-time pulse analysis using 2 statistical methods: root mean square of successive RR difference (RMSSD/mean) and Shannon entropy (ShE). We examined the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of both algorithms using the 12-lead electrocardiogram as the gold standard.
Results
RMSDD/mean and ShE were higher in participants in AF than in those with sinus rhythm. The 2 methods were inversely related to AF in regression models adjusting for key factors including heart rate and blood pressure (beta coefficients per SD increment in RMSDD/mean and ShE were−0.20 and−0.35; P\&lt;.001). An algorithm combining the 2 statistical methods demonstrated excellent sensitivity (0.962), specificity (0.975), and accuracy (0.968) for beat-to-beat discrimination of an irregular pulse during AF from sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
In a prospectively recruited cohort of 76 participants undergoing cardioversion for AF, we found that a novel algorithm analyzing signals recorded using an iPhone 4S accurately distinguished pulse recordings during AF from sinus rhythm. Data are needed to explore the performance and acceptability of smartphone-based applications for AF detection.},

These phones are equipped with high-end processors, high-resolution cameras, and built-in sensors such as accelerometer, orientation-sensor, and light-sensor. According to comScore survey, 26.2\% of U.S. adults use smart phones in their daily lives. Motivated by this statistic and the diverse capability of smart phones, we focus on utilizing them for biomedical applications. We present a new application of the smart phone with its built-in camera and microphone replacing the traditional stethoscope and cuff-based measurement technique, to quantify vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. We propose two differential blood pressure estimating techniques using the heartbeat and pulse data. The first method uses two smart phones whereas the second method replaces one of the phones with a customized external microphone. We estimate the systolic and diastolic pressure in the two techniques by computing the pulse pressure and the stroke volume from the data recorded. By comparing the estimated blood pressure values with those measured using a commercial blood pressure meter, we obtained encouraging results of 95-100\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {As a smartphone is becoming very popular and its performance is being improved fast, a smartphone shows its potential as a low-cost physiological measurement solution which is accurate and can be used beyond the clinical environment. Because cardiac pulse leads the subtle color change of a skin, a pulsatile signal which can be described as photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal can be measured through recording facial video using a digital camera. In this paper, we explore the potential that the reliable heart rate can be measured remotely by the facial video recorded using smartphone camera. First, using the front facing-camera of a smartphone, facial video was recorded. We detected facial region on the image of each frame using face detection, and yielded the raw trace signal from the green channel of the image. To extract more accurate cardiac pulse signal, we applied independent component analysis (ICA) to the raw trace signal. The heart rate was extracted using frequency analysis of the raw trace signal and the analyzed signal from ICA. The accuracy of the estimated heart rate was evaluated by comparing with the heart rate from reference electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Finally, we developed FaceBEAT, an iPhone application for remote heart rate measurement, based on this study.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects three to five million Americans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing methods to diagnose this paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an accuracy of 100\% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.},

However, measuring these indices often requires laborious processes. We therefore developed a new smartphone program, named iPhysioMeter, that makes it possible to measure beat-by-beat HR and ln NPV using only a smartphone. We examined its accuracy against conventional laboratory measures. Mental stress tasks were used to alter HR and ln NPV in 12 participants. Bland–Altman analyses revealed negligible proportional bias for HR and ln NPV or for their change values, expressed as ΔHR and Δln NPV. However, a relatively large fixed bias did emerge for ln NPV, as well as a small one for Δln NPV, although both were within the limits of agreement. These findings suggest that iPhysioMeter can yield valid measures of the absolute level of HR and of relative changes in ln NPV.},

Monitoring was performed in the supine and tilt positions for independent iPhone 4s (2 min recordings, n=9) and Droid (5 min recordings, n=13) experiments, and the following heart rate and heart rate variability parameters were estimated: heart rate, low frequency power, high frequency power, ratio of low to high frequency power, standard deviation of the RR intervals, and root mean square of successive RR-differences.

An important aspect of study in such system is how the data is treated and processed. This paper provides a recent review of the latest methods and algorithms used to analyze data from wearable sensors used for physiological monitoring of vital signs in healthcare services. In particular, the paper outlines the more common data mining tasks that have been applied such as anomaly detection, prediction and decision making when considering in particular continuous time series measurements. Moreover, the paper further details the suitability of particular data mining and machine learning methods used to process the physiological data and provides an overview of the properties of the data sets used in experimental validation. Finally, based on this literature review, a number of key challenges have been outlined for data mining methods in health monitoring systems.},

The objective was to provide a broad spectrum of measurement applications so that the different techniques and approaches could be presented. Digital Image and Signal Processing for Measurement Systems concentrates on signal processing for measurement systems and its objective is to provide a general overview of the area and an appropriate introduction to the topics considered. This is achieved through 10 chapters devoted to current topics of research addressed by different research groups within this area. These 10 chapters reflect advances corresponding to signals of different dimensionality. They go from mostly one dimensional signals in what would be the most traditional area of signal processing realm to RGB signals and to signals of very high dimensionality such as hyperspectral signals that can go up to dimensionalities of more than one thousand. The chapters have been thought out to provide an easy to follow introduction to the topics that are addressed, including the most relevant references, so that anyone interested in this field can get started in the area. They provide an overview of some of the problems in the area of signal and image processing for measurement systems and the approaches and techniques that relevant research groups within this area are employing to try to solve them which, in many instances are the state of the art of some of these topics.},

The system requires the user to place the tip of his/her index finger on the lens of a smart phone camera, while the flash is on. The captured video signal often contains noise generated due to (i) improper finger placement, (ii) imparting excessive pressure, which subsequently blocks normal blood circulation and (iii) movement of the fingertip. To mitigate the above issues, a two stage approach has been proposed. Firstly, the onset of good video signal is detected by formulating a finite state machine, which employs multiple window short time fast fourier transform. Only upon receiving sufficient acceptable video signal, the heart rate is computed. Results indicate that the proposed method has successfully identified and rejected noisy video signal, resulting in avoidance of erroneous output.},

	abstract = {Museums must choose illumination that will optimize observers' aesthetic experiences without compromising preservation of the artworks. Typical lighting is 3000 K at 200 lux. We examined the effects of color temperature by comparing the same “artwork” under several different illuminants (in side-by-side miniature museum rooms); for each painting, observers rated the preference for seeing it under one of the two illuminants; this was repeated for all pairings of illuminants. Our observers preferred higher color temperatures at about 3600 K. Between viewing trials observers' visual systems were adapted to a specific illuminant. This had no effect on preferred illumination of an artwork. To explore a wider range of artworks, we developed a set of numerical scales that could be applied directly to individual pictures; these were viewed, one at a time, in a single simulated room illuminated by one of a series of illuminants. Again, observers preferred a color temperature of about 3600 K. In both studies there was a small interaction between illuminant and color gamut of a given painting. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A strategy is reported to optimize lighting to reduce photochemical degradation of works of art and archival documents. The strategy revolves around improving luminous efficiency of the spectral profile to exclude light which doesn't contribute to brightness or color perception, while also trying to maintain color rendering. The work focuses on Old Master Drawings and designing filters for illuminants, but is applicable to the broad range of art and archival documents and the direct design of lighting without filters such as LED. A filter profile is identified which seems to be beneficial, or at worst neutral for all pigments measured. Underlying principles are identified: (1) The best luminous efficiencies arise from multiple band illuminants, and also improves as color rendering is sacrificed. (2) Protection of an object even late in its damage life can significantly extend its remaining life. (3) Protection of an object early in its life can possibly abate some of the light induced damage it may experience across its life, so early intervention in light protection may be advised. This report further goes on to suggest approaches to further enhance the protection, including tailoring the spectral dependence of appearance change. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The CIE General Colour Rendering Index is currently the criterion used to describe and measure the colour-rendering properties of light sources. But over the past years, there has been increasing evidence of its limitations particularly its ability to predict the perceived colour quality of light sources and especially some LEDs. In this paper, several aspects of perceived colour quality are investigated using a side-by-side paired comparison method, and the following criteria: naturalness of fruits and vegetables, colourfulness of the Macbeth Color Checker chart, visual appreciation (attractiveness/ preference) and colour difference estimations for both visual scenes. Forty-five observers with normal colour vision evaluated nine light sources at 3000 K, and 36 observers evaluated eight light sources at 4000 K. Our results indicate that perceived colour differences are better dealt by the CIECAM02 Uniform Colour Space. Naturalness is better described by fidelity indices even if they did not give perfect predictions for all differences between LED light sources. Colourfulness is well described by gamut-based indices and attractiveness was found to correlate best with gamut-based indices but also with a preference index or a memory index calculated without blue and purple hues. A very low correlation was found between appreciation and naturalness indicating that colour quality needs more than one metric to describe subjective aspects.},

	abstract = {This study looks at the perceived quality of light-emitting diode (LED)-based lighting of various colors. The objective was to find out whether LEDs could provide better (i.e., more relevant and acceptable) lighting than that which is obtained with standard halogen or fluorescent sources. The perception of objects was assessed under different lighting schemes. Subjects were invited to add red, cyan and/or amber to white LED-based light to match the halogen and fluorescence rendering on specific targets: a color chart and a painting. They were also asked to rate the difference between the two, and to express their preference. The results obtained for the perception of LED-based lighting were quite positive. Color blendings of LED light were found to provide illuminated situations similar to halogens or fluorescent sources. These blendings were well accepted, and indeed often preferred, although the color rendering index (CRI) was always low. This indicates that the CRI as it stands is inadequate to characterize the color rendering of solid-state light sources, and needs to be updated. LED-based lighting systems seem to have considerable potential for use in shops and display units, where they may well outperform existing lighting systems. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Lights vary in their ability to render object spectral reflectances into color contrasts. When a light L1 is replaced by another L2, even if L2 matches L1 in chromaticity, systematic color shifts may occur, including a loss or gain of chromatic color. For instance, many familiar lights, when compared to daylight, dull red and green objects, rendering them closer to gray. An opponent colors method is appropriate to this discussion because it brings to the surface the notion of chromatic color, meaning actual departure from white or gray. In this article, an opponent-colors analysis leads to a matrix formulation that serves two purposes. The effects of replacing L1 by L2 are estimated with a 3×3 “rendering matrix” P. Given an object's tristimulus vector under L1, the method makes an approximate prediction of the new tristimulus vector under L2. Thanks to the opponent formulation, matrix element P22 quantifies the gain or loss of redness and greenness, while P33 expresses gain or loss of blueness and yellowness. These in fact are major effects, so the method is both quantitative and explanatory. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The transition from threedimensional architectural rendering to the three-dimensional virtual luminance mapping and visualization within a virtual environment is described as an integrated optical method for its application toward preservation of the cultural heritage of the space. Lighting simulation programs represent color as RGB triplets in a devicedependent color space such as ITU-R BT709. Prerequisite for this is a 3D-model which can be created within this computer aided virtual environment. The onsite measured surface luminance, chromaticity and spectral data were used as input to an established real-time indirect illumination and a physically based algorithms to produce the best approximation for RGB to be used as an input to generate the image of the objects. Conversion of RGB to and from spectra has been a major undertaking in order to match the infinite number of spectra to create the same colors that were defined by RGB in the program. The ability to simulate light intensity, candle power and spectral power distributions provide opportunity to examine the impact of color inter-reflections on historical paintings. VR offers an effective technique to quantify the visible light impact on human visual performance under precisely controlled representation of light spectrum that could be experienced in 3D format in a virtual environment as well as historical visual archives. The system can easily be expanded to include other measurements and stimuli.},

Then they chose their preferred light spectrum using the five LED channels, once as a free choice and once with an illuminance limit. Judgments of the fluorescent spectrum and the LED spectrum with the closest (matched) CCT did not differ. The preset judgments followed a quadratic pattern, with the lowest and highest CCT conditions having lower ratings than the three middle conditions. The free and illuminance-constrained lighting choices did not differ, with individuals’ selections ranging from 2850 to 14,000 K and generally lying slightly below the blackbody curve.},

Eighty-seven participants between 19 and 25 years completed brightness matching and preference comparisons between two full-size side-by-side rooms that contained chromatic objects and still life arrangements, with one lamp type in each room. Participants had higher overall preference to the room illuminated by YD-LED. Specifically, red, green, orange, and wood objects were preferred under YD-LED; no preference was found for neutral, yellow, and blue objects between the two lamp types. The words saturated, vivid, vibrant, pleasant, inviting, colorful, stand-out, distinct, appealing, and comfortable were reported as reasons for the color preference under YD-LED; dull, dead, and fade were used by participants to describe the lower color preference under BP-LED. Skin tone preference under the illumination of these two lamp types was significantly different between Asian (n = 32) and Caucasian (n = 52) participants. Caucasians evaluated their own skin tone more favorably under YD-LED, with the average assessment that skin appeared healthy and colorful under YD-LED but grey and pale under BP-LED. No preference between the two lamps was found among Asians for their skin tone, though some Asians thought YD-LED rendered their skin too red and odd. Many existing measures of color preference and gamut were able to predict the higher overall preference to YD-LED, but they could not predict the preference of specific colors or for ethnic groups. The higher saturation and preference for red and green colors under YD-LED illumination is consistent with the higher red–green opponent signal provided by YD-LED. Coupled with several past studies, the spectral region around 570–580 nm appears to be deleterious to color and brightness perception.},

Colour acceptance boundaries have been determined from the visual assessments of objects under variable illumination or by presenting manipulated images of objects on a calibrated computer display. However, a systematic and quantitative rating of the colour of real objects with respect to memory colour is not available at this moment. In this article, nine familiar real objects with colours distributed around the hue circle were positioned in a specially designed LED illumination box. For each object, approximately hundred real illumination spectra were synthesized in a random order keeping the luminance of the object approximately constant. Observers were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the similarity of the perceived object colour to their idea of what the object looked like in reality. By avoiding specular reflections, the observer was unable to identify any clues as to the colour of the illumination. For each object, similarity ratings showed a good intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The ratings of all the observers were pooled and successfully modeled in IPT colour space by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. It was found that the chromaticity corresponding to the highest rating tended to be shifted toward higher chroma in comparison with the chromaticity calculated under D65 illumination. The bivariate distributions could be very useful in applications where the quantitative evaluation of the colour appearance of an object stimulus is required, such as in the evaluation of the colour rendering capabilities of a light source. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The CIE color rendering (fidelity) index (CRI) has remained unchanged for over four decades. Most, if not all, of its components could be updated to more state-of-the-art methods. One of the most critical components of any color rendering (fidelity) metric is the test sample selection. This article therefore addresses the importance of uniform sampling of wavelength space to avoid selective optimization—that is, taking advantage of the unequal contributions of different wavelength regions to the general color rendering score—of light source spectral power distributions. It summarizes the development of a mathematical sample set with undistorted spectral sensitivity, the HL17 set. The set is used in a recently proposed update, the CRI2012 general color rendering index. To assess the impact of the spectrally uniform sample set on color fidelity scores, the CRI2012 index values for each of a set of 139 lamps were compared with those of the CIE CRI. In addition, the impact of updating the other components was investigated. A mean and maximum absolute difference of respectively 5.9 and 21.8 index units were found between the CRI2012 and CIE CRI, although the largest part—respectively 4.03 and 19.7 index units—was shown to be the result of updating the color difference engine and the switch to the CIE 10° observer. The analysis also indicated possible past spectral selective optimization of some warm-white tri-band fluorescent sources for high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) and (just) sufficient CIE Ra values by taking advantage of the spectral nonuniformity of the CIE reflectance set. Adopting a spectrally uniform sample set in a color rendering metric therefore has important practical implications when designing light source spectra. Finally, possible updates and further improvements of the CRI2012 are briefly mentioned.},

It has been theorized that there may be a large amount of overlap between the neural representations of these objects and processing involved in color perception. In accordance with this theory we sought to determine if the recognition of highly color diagnostic fruit objects could be facilitated by the visual presentation of their known color associates. In two experiments we show that color associate priming is possible, but contingent upon multiple factors. Color priming was found to be maximally effective for the most highly color diagnostic fruits, when low spatial-frequency information was present in the image, and when determination of the object's specific identity, not merely its category, was required. These data illustrate the importance of color for determining the identity of certain objects, and support the theory that object knowledge involves sensory specific systems.},

	abstract = {Traditional color appearance modeling has recently matured to the point that available, internationally recommended models such as CIECAM02 are capable of making a wide range of predictions, to within the observer variability in color matching and color scaling of stimuli, in somewhat simplified viewing conditions. It is proposed that the next significant advances in the field of color appearance modeling and image quality metrics will not come from evolutionary revisions of colorimetric color appearance models alone. Instead, a more revolutionary approach will be required to make appearance and difference predictions for more complex stimuli in a wider array of viewing conditions. Such an approach can be considered image appearance modeling, since it extends the concepts of color appearance modeling to stimuli and viewing environments that are spatially and temporally at the level of complexity of real natural and man-made scenes, and extends traditional image quality metrics into the color appearance domain. Thus, two previously parallel and evolving research areas are combined in a new way as an attempt to instigate a significant advance. We review the concepts of image appearance modeling, present iCAM as one example of such a model, and provide a number of examples of the use of iCAM in image reproduction and image quality evaluation. © 2004 SPIE and IS\&T.},

	abstract = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode–based sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to span 0–100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

The output spectral irradiance or radiance of the source will be calibrated by a reference instrument, and the source will be used as a spectroradiometric as well as a photometric and colorimetric standard. A series of simulations have been conducted to predict the performance of the designed tunable source when used for calibration of display colorimeters. The results indicate that the errors can be reduced by an order of magnitude when the tunable source is used to calibrate the colorimeters, compared with measurement errors when the colorimeters are calibrated against Illuminant A.

Since the introduction of the CRI to the present day, alternative methods have been proposed and studied. Some methods are based on the shape of the spectral output of the source, considering broadband sources to have better color rendering than sources with spectral peaks or valleys. Several proposals share the basic method of CRI, with modifications to improve performance. Still other ideas are based on measures of the gamut area of rendered object colors.

The CIE color-rendering index (CRI) is a single number based on the average color difference for eight test colors. Ever since its introduction the CRI has been discussed and several suggestions have been made to improve the description of the CRI such as color preference index, color appearance data and color discrimination index. New lighting technologies such as LEDs can have spectral power distributions consisting of narrow spectral bands in the red, green and blue region of the spectrum. There are indications that the CRI does not always provide a reliable description of the color-rendering properties of these LED based light sources. In this article the principal elements of the CRI calculation are analyzed and their influence on the color-rendering description will be discussed. The focus of the analysis has been on the selection of object colors. Principally the color-rendering description of a light source should not depend on the set of colors chosen for the calculation. From our analysis requirements for such color sets are given. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2010},

Multi-chip and phosphor-type white LED models were analyzed by simulation on their color characteristics and luminous efficacy of radiation, compared with those of conventional light sources for general lighting. Color rendering characteristics were evaluated based on the CIE Color Rendering Index (CRI), using not only R a but also the special color rendering indices R i as well as the CIELAB color difference ΔE *ab for the 14 color samples defined in CIE 13.3. Several models of 3-chip and 4-chip white LEDs as well as phosphor-type LEDs are optimized for various parameters, and some guidance is given for designing these white LEDs. The simulation analysis also demonstrated several problems with the current CIE Color Rendering Index (CRI), and the need for improvements is discussed.},

	abstract = {Most descriptions of the color rendering properties of light sources are based on the calculation of color differences for a number of reflectance samples between the light source and a reference source. The CIE color rendering index (CRI) is a single number based on the average color difference for eight reflectance samples. Since its introduction, the CRI has been discussed at length and many alternatives have been suggested to improve the description of color rendering. These metrics comprise among others, metrics based on color fidelity, color gamut, and color preference and combinations of these. All of these new proposals try to capture a certain color rendering aspect in a single number index to be used instead of or together with the existing CIE CRI. The “traditional” CRI has been criticized due to the fact that a single number index does not provide sufficient information about the color rendering properties of light sources. Creating a (second) single number metric seems to be a bit of a paradox, because it suffers from the same limitation by providing an average number to characterize certain color aspects for all colors. In our view, the best way to provide users of lighting in whatever application with accurate information on color characteristics is to provide specific information on the most important color characteristics such as hue, chroma, and lightness. In this article, we describe our methods of supplying hue-specific information via color rendering vectors and color rendering icons. We illustrate why we believe that it is important to add hue-specific information and what the shortcomings are of a second hue-averaged metric. We acknowledge that color appearance models have advanced since our first calculations and that it would be more appropriate to use CIECAM02. In addition, several recent papers have appeared discussing improved reflectance sample sets. These advancements, however, do not change the key message in this article, which advocates the use of graphics to communicate shifts in hue and chroma.},

For instance, calculation of tî and dî for daylight shows that on a gray day, color contrasts are actually reduced. By these measures, many common vapor-discharge illuminants systematically distort object colors. Because red-green contrasts contribute to border distinctness, and both types of color contrast contribute to brightness, such systematic distortions probably affect the overall clarity and brightness of what is perceived visually. Experimental data are consistent with this idea.In relation to color-constancy (retinex) experiments, it is approximately true that the visual system discounts the color of an illuminant but not its tî and dî.},

The basic physical processes are defined, and the effects of ultraviolet (uv), luminous flux and infrared (IR) exposure on object degradation are examined.

The aim for lighting and conservation of museum objects is defined as satisfying viewers with the least possible amount of energy being absorbed by the displayed object. Current standards and recommended practices are reviewed, and it is concluded that museum lighting policies should be directed towards control of non-visible irradiance, both IR and uv, and that future research should move beyond examining fading effects of exposure to studying ways to satisfy viewers with minimum absorbed energy.},

	abstract = {The original experimental work of CIE to establish a method for assessing the colour rendering properties of light sources has been analysed. The spectral power distribution of the Standard Warm White fluorescent lamp, used in that experiment to define a General Colour Rendering Index (Ra) equal to 50, is presented with extended spectral range and resolution. This lamp was used to compute new Ra indices when the CIE(1964)UVW formula was substituted by the CIELUV or the new, improved SVF colour space formula. Ten fluorescent and discharge lamps and two extra sets of colour samples were included in this investigation. The Special Colour Rendering Indices (Ri) for each sample of a set of 24 saturated colours show large deviations when the UVW formula is substituted by the SVF formula. Less variation is seen for the averaged Ra indices. However, for the Warm White de Luxe lamp investigated by the CIE committee, only the SVF formula yields a Ra index equal to that obtained by visual rating. The SVF formula includes a correction for chromatic adaptation that correlates well with physiological data. This improved adaptation transform makes it possible to use daylight illumination as a fixed reference source. This leads to drastic changes of the Ra-values, mainly due to a systematic degradation of Ra with decreasing correlated colour temperature. It is suggested that the use of the SVF formula, in combination with a set of 20 colour samples of constant lightness and saturation and with hues evenly distributed along the colour circle, will lead to an improved colour rendering index, tentatively called the Rb index. Our investigations indicate that, compared to the present CIE Ra index, only minor changes will result for the Standard, de Luxe and broad-band type of lamps. For modern energy saving lamps with irregular spectral power distribution, however, like three-three-band and most of the discharge lamps, the Rb index may deviate significantly and lead to more realistic values.},

	abstract = {Two white lights may have the same chromaticity, and yet when used to light an array of objects may differ in their ability to reveal colors. For example, any white light can be matched by a mixture of two narrow-band lights, a yellow plus a blue. In this extreme case, reds and greens become black or brown and the red-green dimension is lost. At the other extreme, a light with three narrow bands, at the proper wavelengths, can brighten reds and greens and increase red-green contrast, relative to a broad-band light such as daylight. Many commercial lights tend to dull reds and greens, relative to broad-band sources, a central reason that color rendering is a practical concern. A telling example is neodymium glass, a yellow-absorbing filter that is sometimes used to improve color rendering.

This effect has been studied by a number of researchers, but the cause of this effect has not been thoroughly studied. In order to clarify this, the mutual relations between visual clarity, lightness perception, and feeling of contrast are analyzed by using object colors under illuminations with various Ra values. the results obtained are as follows. (1) the visual clarity of a lighting environment is different from the lightness perception of the object colors in the environment. (2) the change in visual clarity of a lighting environment is highly correlated to a feeling of contrast between object colors under the illumination. (3) the effect of visual clarity is estimated effectively by assessing the feeling of contrast using a specially selected four-color combination. (4) the illuminance for equal visual clarity for any illumination is predicted by the equality of feeling of contrast under the same illumination specified by the gamut area made by the component colors of the four-color combination in a brightness and colorfulness space. (5) the effect of visual clarity under various illuminations cannot be predicted by using their Ra values.},

	abstract = {For many people, the correct perception of the colors of objects is an important part of life, and today it is being threatened by misinformed policy-making and associated business decisions.Some conservationists and lamp manufacturers have concluded that the accurate color rendering provided by ordinary incandescent lamps is an unaffordable luxury that good citizens should forgo as we employ more energy-efficient alternatives. Though this is not as extreme as suggesting that we should live in cold darkness, it is in the same general direction of deprivation.Yet research has shown that color rendering is important to people and high-efficiency lamps can now also provide high color rendering, so there is no longer any need to have lighting that distorts color appearance. This article focuses on the tradeoff between color rendering accuracy and lamp efficiency to show that high color rendering accuracy is appropriate and, contrary to a common misconception, does not intrinsically require greater electrical energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Artificial lighting allows humans to be active at night, but has many unintended consequences, including interference with ecological processes, disruption of circadian rhythms and increased exposure to insect vectors of diseases. Although ultraviolet and blue light are usually most attractive to arthropods, degree of attraction varies among orders. With a focus on future indoor lighting applications, we manipulated the spectrum of white lamps to investigate the influence of spectral composition on number of arthropods attracted. We compared numbers of arthropods captured at three customizable light-emitting diode (LED) lamps (3510, 2704 and 2728 K), two commercial LED lamps (2700 K), two commercial compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs; 2700 K) and a control. We configured the three custom LEDs to minimize invertebrate attraction based on published attraction curves for honeybees and moths. Lamps were placed with pan traps at an urban and two rural study sites in Los Angeles, California. For all invertebrate orders combined, our custom LED configurations were less attractive than the commercial LED lamps or CFLs of similar colour temperatures. Thus, adjusting spectral composition of white light to minimize attracting nocturnal arthropods is feasible; not all lights with the same colour temperature are equally attractive to arthropods.},

	abstract = {The availability of electric lighting has changed the lives of people the world over, yet as a major user of electricity it has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. This scrutiny has focused largely on the environmental consequences, with little consideration of the benefits of lighting. Human Factors in Lighting, Third Edition restores some balance to the discussion by examining the ways in which people interact with lighting. These interactions influence the ability to perform visual tasks; the perception of people, objects, and spaces; human comfort and behavior; as well as human health and safety. It is only by understanding how to use light to achieve these ends that lighting can be provided effectively and efficiently to the benefit of all. See What’s New in the Third Edition:   New chapters on the non-image-forming system, lighting for pedestrians, light pollution, and lighting and electricity use  Revision of all other chapters to update them to take into account the advances that have been made in our understanding of the effects of light on people over the last decade  Integration of the combined effects of light via the visual and non-image-forming systems on performance and perception   The book covers both the visual and the non-visual effects of light on people as well as the benefits of lighting and the costs it imposes on the environment. It details the consequences of exposure to lighting or lighting technology and the role of exposure to light on such basic functions of the body as circadian rhythms. The author combines information from many different sources and integrates them into a coherent overview of lighting practice that can be used to develop better lighting solutions at a lower environmental cost.},
